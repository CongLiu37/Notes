Initiation of dFOXO overexpression at different ages increased subsequent lifespan compared to controls, with the magnitude of the increase decreasing as the flies were put on RU486 at older age. The effects of removal of dFOXO overexpression at different ages closely mirrored those of induction of expression , and produced shorter lifespan compared to +RU486 controls, with the shortest lifespans observed in flies taken off RU486 at the earlier ages.	pro		33	Overexpression

Most importantly, over-expression of Imp-L2 using the hsGAL4 driver significantly extended the lifespan of female flies at 25C, with median lifespan extended by 15%, while the maximum lifespan remained unchanged with this driver. To examine adult-onset over-expression, we used the inducible Actin GeneSwitch (ActGS) driver. ActGS drives ubiquitous transgene expression but only in the presence of the RU486 steroid drug. Addition of RU486 to food had no effect on lifespan of ActGS or UAS-Imp-L2 controls, while in ActGS > UAS-Imp-L2 adult female flies it almost doubled the period where no deaths were observed and resulted in a 20% increase in median lifespan, as well as a smaller increase in maximal lifespan.
