    Shotgun metagenomic sequencing has revolutionized our ability to detect and characterize the diversity and function of complex microbial communities. 
    In this review, we highlight the benefits of using metagenomics as well as the breadth of conclusions that can be made using currently available analytical tools, such as greater resolution of species and strains across phyla and functional content, while highlighting challenges of metagenomic data analysis. 
    Major challenges remain in annotating function, given the dearth of functional databases for environmental bacteria compared to model organisms, and the technical difficulties of metagenome assembly and phasing in heterogeneous environmental samples. 
    In the future, improvements and innovation in technology and methodology will lead to lowered costs. 
    Data integration using multiple technological platforms will lead to a better understanding of how to harness metagenomes. 
    Subsequently, we will be able not only to characterize complex microbiomes but also to manipulate communities to achieve prosperous outcomes for health, agriculture, and environmental sustainability.

    Over the past decade, it has become exceedingly clear that the microbiome is a critical factor in human health and disease and thus should be investigated to develop innovative treatment strategies. 
    The field of metagenomics has come a long way in leveraging the advances of next-generation sequencing technologies resulting in the capability to identify and quantify all microorganisms present in human specimens. 
    However, the field of metagenomics is still in its infancy, specifically in regard to the limitations in computational analysis, statistical assessments, standardization, and validation due to vast variability in the cohorts themselves, experimental design, and bioinformatic workflows. 
    This review summarizes the methods, technologies, computational tools, and model systems for characterizing and studying the microbiome. 
    We also discuss important considerations investigators must make when interrogating the involvement of the microbiome in health and disease in order to establish robust results and mechanistic insights before moving into therapeutic design and intervention.

    Diverse microbial communities of bacteria, archaea, viruses and single-celled eukaryotes have crucial roles in the environment and in human health. 
    However, microbes are frequently difficult to culture in the laboratory, which can confound cataloging of members and understanding of how communities function. 
    High-throughput sequencing technologies and a suite of computational pipelines have been combined into shotgun metagenomics methods that have transformed microbiology. 
    Still, computational approaches to overcome the challenges that affect both assembly-based and mapping-based metagenomic profiling, particularly of high-complexity samples or environments containing organisms with limited similarity to sequenced genomes, are needed. 
    Understanding the functions and characterizing specific strains of these communities offers biotechnological promise in therapeutic discovery and innovative ways to synthesize products using microbial factories and can pinpoint the contributions of microorganisms to planetary, animal and human health.
