    Shotgun metagenomic sequencing has revolutionized our ability to detect and characterize the diversity and function of complex microbial communities. 
    In this review, we highlight the benefits of using metagenomics as well as the breadth of conclusions that can be made using currently available analytical tools, such as greater resolution of species and strains across phyla and functional content, while highlighting challenges of metagenomic data analysis. 
    Major challenges remain in annotating function, given the dearth of functional databases for environmental bacteria compared to model organisms, and the technical difficulties of metagenome assembly and phasing in heterogeneous environmental samples. 
    In the future, improvements and innovation in technology and methodology will lead to lowered costs. 
    Data integration using multiple technological platforms will lead to a better understanding of how to harness metagenomes. 
    Subsequently, we will be able not only to characterize complex microbiomes but also to manipulate communities to achieve prosperous outcomes for health, agriculture, and environmental sustainability.

    Over the past decade, it has become exceedingly clear that the microbiome is a critical factor in human health and disease and thus should be investigated to develop innovative treatment strategies. 
    The field of metagenomics has come a long way in leveraging the advances of next-generation sequencing technologies resulting in the capability to identify and quantify all microorganisms present in human specimens. 
    However, the field of metagenomics is still in its infancy, specifically in regard to the limitations in computational analysis, statistical assessments, standardization, and validation due to vast variability in the cohorts themselves, experimental design, and bioinformatic workflows. 
    This review summarizes the methods, technologies, computational tools, and model systems for characterizing and studying the microbiome. 
    We also discuss important considerations investigators must make when interrogating the involvement of the microbiome in health and disease in order to establish robust results and mechanistic insights before moving into therapeutic design and intervention.

    Diverse microbial communities of bacteria, archaea, viruses and single-celled eukaryotes have crucial roles in the environment and in human health. 
    However, microbes are frequently difficult to culture in the laboratory, which can confound cataloging of members and understanding of how communities function. 
    High-throughput sequencing technologies and a suite of computational pipelines have been combined into shotgun metagenomics methods that have transformed microbiology. 
    Still, computational approaches to overcome the challenges that affect both assembly-based and mapping-based metagenomic profiling, particularly of high-complexity samples or environments containing organisms with limited similarity to sequenced genomes, are needed. 
    Understanding the functions and characterizing specific strains of these communities offers biotechnological promise in therapeutic discovery and innovative ways to synthesize products using microbial factories and can pinpoint the contributions of microorganisms to planetary, animal and human health.

Although there are many benchmark utilities designed for single-genome assemblies, there is no well-recognized evaluation and comparison tool for metagenomic-specific analogues. In this article, we present MetaQUAST, a modification of QUAST, the state-of-the-art tool for genome assembly evaluation based on alignment of contigs to a reference. MetaQUAST addresses such metagenome datasets features as (i) unknown species content by detecting and downloading reference sequences, (ii) huge diversity by giving comprehensive reports for multiple genomes and (iii) presence of highly relative species by detecting chimeric contigs. We demonstrate MetaQUAST performance by comparing several leading assemblers on one simulated and two real datasets.

    With the constant improvement in cost-efficiency and quality of Next Generation Sequencing technologies, shotgun-sequencing approaches -such as metagenomics- have nowadays become the methods of choice for studying and classifying microorganisms from various habitats. The production of data has dramatically increased over the past years and processing and analysis steps are becoming more and more of a bottleneck. Limiting factors are partly the availability of computational resources, but mainly the bioinformatics expertise in establishing and applying appropriate processing and analysis pipelines. Fortunately, a large diversity of specialized software tools is nowadays available. Nevertheless, choosing the most appropriate methods for answering specific biological questions can be rather challenging, especially for non-bioinformaticians. In order to provide a comprehensive overview and guide for the microbiological scientific community, we assessed the most common and freely available metagenome assembly tools with respect to their output statistics, their sensitivity for low abundant community members and variability in resulting community profiles as well as their ease-of-use. In contrast to the highly anticipated "Critical Assessment of Metagenomic Interpretation" (CAMI) challenge, which uses general mock community-based assembler comparison we here tested assemblers on real Illumina metagenome sequencing data from natural communities of varying complexity sampled from forest soil and algal biofilms. Our observations clearly demonstrate that different assembly tools can prove optimal, depending on the sample type, available computational resources and, most importantly, the specific research goal. In addition, we present detailed descriptions of the underlying principles and pitfalls of publically available assembly tools from a microbiologist’s perspective, and provide guidance regarding the user-friendliness, sensitivity and reliability of the resulting phylogenetic profiles.

    In recent years, the use of longer range read data combined with advances in assembly algorithms has stimulated big improvements in the contiguity and quality of genome assemblies. 
    However, these advances have not directly transferred to metagenomic data sets, as assumptions made by the single genome assembly algorithms do not apply when assembling multiple genomes at varying levels of abundance. 
    The development of dedicated assemblers for metagenomic data was a relatively late innovation and for many years, researchers had to make do using tools designed for single genomes. 
    This has changed in the last few years and we have seen the emergence of a new type of tool built using different principles. 
    In this review, we describe the challenges inherent in metagenomic assemblies and compare the different approaches taken by these novel assembly tools.

    Genomes are an integral component of the biological information about an organism; thus, the more complete the genome, the more informative it is. 
    Historically, bacterial and archaeal genomes were reconstructed from pure (monoclonal) cultures, and the first reported sequences were manually curated to completion. 
    However, the bottleneck imposed by the requirement for isolates precluded genomic insights for the vast majority of microbial life. 
    Shotgun sequencing of microbial communities, referred to initially as community genomics and subsequently as genome-resolved metagenomics, can circumvent this limitation by obtaining metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs); but gaps, local assembly errors, chimeras, and contamination by fragments from other genomes limit the value of these genomes. 
    Here, we discuss genome curation to improve and, in some cases, achieve complete (circularized, no gaps) MAGs (CMAGs). 
    To date, few CMAGs have been generated, although notably some are from very complex systems such as soil and sediment. 
    Through analysis of about 7000 published complete bacterial isolate genomes, we verify the value of cumulative GC skew in combination with other metrics to establish bacterial genome sequence accuracy. 
    The analysis of cumulative GC skew identified potential misassemblies in some reference genomes of isolated bacteria and the repeat sequences that likely gave rise to them. 
    We discuss methods that could be implemented in bioinformatic approaches for curation to ensure that metabolic and evolutionary analyses can be based on very high-quality genomes.

    Microorganisms and the viruses that infect them are the most numerous biological entities on Earth and enclose its greatest biodiversity and genetic reservoir. With strength in their numbers, these microscopic organisms are major players in the cycles of energy and matter that sustain all life. Scientists have only scratched the surface of this vast microbial world through culture-dependent methods. Recent developments in generating metagenomes, large random samples of nucleic acid sequences isolated directly from the environment, are providing comprehensive portraits of the composition, structure, and functioning of microbial communities. Moreover, advances in metagenomic analysis have created the possibility of obtaining complete or nearly complete genome sequences from uncultured microorganisms, providing important means to study their biology, ecology, and evolution. Here we review some of the recent developments in the field of metagenomics, focusing on the discovery of genetic novelty and on methods for obtaining uncultured genome sequences, including through the recycling of previously published datasets. Moreover we discuss how metagenomics has become a core scientific tool to characterize eco-evolutionary patterns of microbial ecosystems, thus allowing us to simultaneously discover new microbes and study their natural communities. We conclude by discussing general guidelines and challenges for modeling the interactions between uncultured microorganisms and viruses based on the information contained in their genome sequences. These models will significantly advance our understanding of the functioning of microbial ecosystems and the roles of microbes in the environment.

    Shotgun metagenomics and computational analysis are used to compare the taxonomic and functional profiles of microbial communities. 
    Leveraging this approach to understand roles of microbes in human biology and other environments requires quantitative data summaries whose values are comparable across samples and studies. 
    Comparability is currently hampered by the use of abundance statistics that do not estimate a meaningful parameter of the microbial community and biases introduced by experimental protocols and data-cleaning approaches. 
    Addressing these challenges, along with improving study design, data access, metadata standardization, and analysis tools, will enable accurate comparative metagenomics. 
    We envision a future in which microbiome studies are replicable and new metagenomes are easily and rapidly integrated with existing data. 
    Only then can the potential of metagenomics for predictive ecological modeling, well-powered association studies, and effective microbiome medicine be fully realized.

    Microbial communities carry out the majority of the biochemical activity on the planet, and they play integral roles in processes including metabolism and immune homeostasis in the human microbiome. Shotgun sequencing of such communities' metagenomes provides information complementary to organismal abundances from taxonomic markers, but the resulting data typically comprise short reads from hundreds of different organisms and are at best challenging to assemble comparably to single-organism genomes. Here, we describe an alternative approach to infer the functional and metabolic potential of a microbial community metagenome. We determined the gene families and pathways present or absent within a community, as well as their relative abundances, directly from short sequence reads. We validated this methodology using a collection of synthetic metagenomes, recovering the presence and abundance both of large pathways and of small functional modules with high accuracy. We subsequently applied this method, HUMAnN, to the microbial communities of 649 metagenomes drawn from seven primary body sites on 102 individuals as part of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). This provided a means to compare functional diversity and organismal ecology in the human microbiome, and we determined a core of 24 ubiquitously present modules. Core pathways were often implemented by different enzyme families within different body sites, and 168 functional modules and 196 metabolic pathways varied in metagenomic abundance specifically to one or more niches within the microbiome. These included glycosaminoglycan degradation in the gut, as well as phosphate and amino acid transport linked to host phenotype (vaginal pH) in the posterior fornix. An implementation of our methodology is available at http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann. This provides a means to accurately and efficiently characterize microbial metabolic pathways and functional modules directly from high-throughput sequencing reads, enabling the determination of community roles in the HMP cohort and in future metagenomic studies.

    Metagenomics analysis revealing the composition and functional repertoire of complex microbial communities typically relies on large amounts of sequence data. Numerous analysis strategies and computational tools are available for their analysis. Fully integrated automated analysis pipelines such as MG-RAST or MEGAN6 are user-friendly but not designed for integrating specific knowledge on the biological system under study. In order to facilitate the consideration of such knowledge, we introduce a modular, adaptable analysis pipeline combining existing tools. We applied the novel pipeline to simulated mock data sets focusing on anaerobic digestion microbiomes and compare results to those obtained with established automated analysis pipelines. We find that the analysis strategy and choice of tools and parameters have a strong effect on the inferred taxonomic community composition, but not on the inferred functional profile. By including prior knowledge, computational costs can be decreased while improving result accuracy. While automated off-the-shelf analysis pipelines are easy to apply and require no knowledge on the microbial system under study, custom-made pipelines require more preparation time and bioinformatics expertise. This extra effort is minimized by our modular, flexible, custom-made pipeline, which can be adapted to different scenarios and can take available knowledge on the microbial system under study into account.

    To assess the functional capacities of microbial communities, including those inhabiting the human body, shotgun metagenomic reads are often aligned to a database of known genes. Such homology-based annotation practices critically rely on the assumption that short reads can map to orthologous genes of similar function. This assumption, however, and the various factors that impact short read annotation, have not been systematically evaluated. To address this challenge, we generated an extremely large database of simulated reads (totaling 15.9 Gb), spanning over 500,000 microbial genes and 170 curated genomes and including, for many genomes, every possible read of a given length. We annotated each read using common metagenomic protocols, fully characterizing the effect of read length, sequencing error, phylogeny, database coverage, and mapping parameters. We additionally rigorously quantified gene-, genome-, and protocol-specific annotation biases. Overall, our findings provide a first comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of functional metagenomic annotation, providing crucial goal-specific best-practice guidelines to inform future metagenomic research.

    Obtaining an unbiased view of the phylogenetic composition and functional diversity within a microbial community is one central objective of metagenomic analysis. New technologies, such as 454 pyrosequencing, have dramatically reduced sequencing costs, to a level where metagenomic analysis may become a viable alternative to more-focused assessments of the phylogenetic (e.g., 16S rRNA genes) and functional diversity of microbial communities. To determine whether the short (∼100 to 200 bp) sequence reads obtained from pyrosequencing are appropriate for the phylogenetic and functional characterization of microbial communities, the results of BLAST and COG analyses were compared for long (∼750 bp) and randomly derived short reads from each of two microbial and one virioplankton metagenome libraries. Overall, BLASTX searches against the GenBank nr database found far fewer homologs within the short-sequence libraries. This was especially pronounced for a Chesapeake Bay virioplankton metagenome library. Increasing the short-read sampling depth or the length of derived short reads (up to 400 bp) did not completely resolve the discrepancy in BLASTX homolog detection. Only in cases where the long-read sequence had a close homolog (low BLAST E-score) did the derived short-read sequence also find a significant homolog. Thus, more-distant homologs of microbial and viral genes are not detected by short-read sequences. Among COG hits, derived short reads sampled at a depth of two short reads per long read missed up to 72% of the COG hits found using long reads. Noting the current limitation in computational approaches for the analysis of short sequences, the use of short-read-length libraries does not appear to be an appropriate tool for the metagenomic characterization of microbial communities.

    Accurate microbial identification and abundance estimation are crucial for metagenomics analysis. 
    Various methods for classification of metagenomic data and estimation of taxonomic profiles, broadly referred to as metagenomic profilers, have been developed. 
    Nevertheless, benchmarking of metagenomic profilers remains challenging because some tools are designed to report relative sequence abundance while others report relative taxonomic abundance. 
    Here we show how misleading conclusions can be drawn by neglecting this distinction between relative abundance types when benchmarking metagenomic profilers. 
    Moreover, we show compelling evidence that interchanging sequence abundance and taxonomic abundance will influence both per-sample summary statistics and cross-sample comparisons. 
    We suggest that the microbiome research community pay attention to potentially misleading biological conclusions arising from this issue when benchmarking metagenomic profilers, by carefully considering the type of abundance data that were analyzed and interpreted and clearly stating the strategy used for metagenomic profiling.

    Most current approach to metagenomic classification employ short next generation sequencing (NGS) reads that are present in metagenomic samples to identify unique genomic regions. NGS reads, however, might not be long enough to differentiate similar genomes. This suggests a potential for using longer reads to improve classification performance. Presently, longer reads tend to have a higher rate of sequencing errors. Thus, given the pros and cons, it remains unclear which types of reads is better for metagenomic classification. We compared two taxonomic classification protocols: a traditional assembly-free protocol and a novel assembly-based protocol. The novel assembly-based protocol consists of assembling short-reads into longer reads, which will be subsequently classified by a traditional taxonomic classifier. We discovered that most classifiers made fewer predictions with longer reads and that they achieved higher classification performance on synthetic metagenomic data. Generally, we observed a significant increase in precision, while having similar recall rates. On real data, we observed similar characteristics that suggest that the classifiers might have similar performance of higher precision with similar recall with longer reads. We have shown a noticeable difference in performance between assembly-based and assembly-free taxonomic classification. This finding strongly suggests that classifying species in metagenomic environments can be achieved with higher overall performance simply by assembling short reads. Further, it also suggests that long-read technologies might be better for species classification.

  abstract = {
    There are many sequencing-based approaches to understanding 
complex metagenomic communities, spanning targeted 
amplification to whole-sample shotgun sequencing. While 
targeted approaches provide valuable data at low sequencing 
depth, they are limited by primer design and PCR amplification. 
Whole-sample shotgun experiments require a high depth of 
coverage. As such, rare community members may not be 
represented in the resulting assembly. Circular-consensus, Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT®) 
Sequencing reads in the 1-2 kb range, with >99% consensus 
accuracy can be efficiently generated for low amounts of input 
DNA, e.g. as little as 10 ng of input DNA sequenced in 4 SMRT 
Cells can generate >100,000 such reads. While throughput is 
low compared to second-generation sequencing, the reads are a 
true random sampling of the underlying community. Long read 
lengths translate to a high number of the reads harboring full 
genes or even full operons for downstream analysis.  Here we present the results of circular-consensus sequencing on 
a mock  metagenomic community with an abundance range of 
multiple orders of magnitude, and compare the results with both 
16S and shotgun assembly methods. We show that even with 
relatively low sequencing depth, the long-read, assembly-free, 
random sampling allows to elucidate meaningful information 
from the very low-abundance community members. For 
example, given the above low-input sequencing approach, a 
community member at 1/1,000 relative abundance would 
generate 100 1-2 kb sequence fragments having 99% 
consensus accuracy, with a high probability of containing a gene 
fragment useful for taxonomic classification or functional insight.

    Currently there is an explosive increase of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects and related datasets, which have to be processed by Quality Control (QC) procedures before they could be utilized for omics analysis. QC procedure usually includes identification and filtration of sequencing artifacts such as low-quality reads and contaminating reads, which would significantly affect and sometimes mislead downstream analysis. Quality control of NGS data for microbial communities is especially challenging. In this work, we have evaluated and compared the performance and effects of various QC pipelines on different types of metagenomic NGS data and from different angles, based on which general principles of using QC pipelines were proposed. Results based on both simulated and real metagenomic datasets have shown that: firstly, QC-Chain is superior in its ability for contamination identification for metagenomic NGS datasets with different complexities with high sensitivity and specificity. Secondly, the high performance computing engine enabled QC-Chain to achieve a significant reduction in processing time compared to other pipelines based on serial computing. Thirdly, QC-Chain could outperform other tools in benefiting downstream metagenomic data analysis.

    Characterizing species diversity and composition of bacteria hosted by biota is revolutionizing our understanding of the role of symbiotic interactions in ecosystems. Determining microbiomes diversity implies the assignment of individual reads to taxa by comparison to reference databases. Although computational methods aimed at identifying the microbe(s) taxa are available, it is well known that inferences using different methods can vary widely depending on various biases. In this study, we first apply and compare different bioinformatics methods based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene and shotgun sequencing to three mock communities of bacteria, of which the compositions are known. We show that none of these methods can infer both the true number of taxa and their abundances. We thus propose a novel approach, named Core-Kaiju, which combines the power of shotgun metagenomics data with a more focused marker gene classification method similar to 16S, but based on emergent statistics of core protein domain families. We thus test the proposed method on various mock communities and we show that Core-Kaiju reliably predicts both number of taxa and abundances. Finally, we apply our method on human gut samples, showing how Core-Kaiju may give more accurate ecological characterization and a fresh view on real microbiomes.

    Due to the complexity of the protocols and a limited knowledge of the nature of microbial communities, simulating metagenomic sequences plays an important role in testing the performance of existing tools and data analysis methods with metagenomic data. We developed metagenomic read simulators with platform-specific (Sanger, pyrosequencing, Illumina) base-error models, and simulated metagenomes of differing community complexities. We first evaluated the effect of rigorous quality control on Illumina data. Although quality filtering removed a large proportion of the data, it greatly improved the accuracy and contig lengths of resulting assemblies. We then compared the quality-trimmed Illumina assemblies to those from Sanger and pyrosequencing. For the simple community (10 genomes) all sequencing technologies assembled a similar amount and accurately represented the expected functional composition. For the more complex community (100 genomes) Illumina produced the best assemblies and more correctly resembled the expected functional composition. For the most complex community (400 genomes) there was very little assembly of reads from any sequencing technology. However, due to the longer read length the Sanger reads still represented the overall functional composition reasonably well. We further examined the effect of scaffolding of contigs using paired-end Illumina reads. It dramatically increased contig lengths of the simple community and yielded minor improvements to the more complex communities. Although the increase in contig length was accompanied by increased chimericity, it resulted in more complete genes and a better characterization of the functional repertoire. The metagenomic simulators developed for this research are freely available.

    Background

Metagenomes can be analysed using different approaches and tools. One of the most important distinctions is the way to perform taxonomic and functional assignment, choosing between the use of assembly algorithms or the direct analysis of raw sequence reads instead by homology searching, k-mer analysys, or detection of marker genes. Many instances of each approach can be found in the literature, but to the best of our knowledge no evaluation of their different performances has been carried on, and we question if their results are comparable.
Results

We have analysed several real and mock metagenomes using different methodologies and tools, and compared the resulting taxonomic and functional profiles. Our results show that database completeness (the representation of diverse organisms and taxa in it) is the main factor determining the performance of the methods relying on direct read assignment either by homology, k-mer composition or similarity to marker genes, while methods relying on assembly and assignment of predicted genes are most influenced by metagenomic size, that in turn determines the completeness of the assembly (the percentage of read that were assembled).
Conclusions

Although differences exist, taxonomic profiles are rather similar between raw read assignment and assembly assignment methods, while they are more divergent for methods based on k-mers and marker genes. Regarding functional annotation, analysis of raw reads retrieves more functions, but it also makes a substantial number of over-predictions. Assembly methods are more advantageous as the size of the metagenome grows bigger.

    A ‘metagenome’ is the theoretical collection of genomes from all members of a given microbial community, and a ‘metagenomic data set’ is the subset captured in a given sequencing event. Although these terms are often used interchangeably and metagenomic data sets are regularly called metagenomes by synecdoche, their relationship is analogous to sample and population in statistics. The fraction of the metagenome represented in the metagenomic data set, termed coverage (not to be confused with the repetition of features, termed sequencing depth), is of key importance in assessing statistical significance of features sampled (taxa, genes and so on). However, quantitative computational methods to assess the level of coverage are limited, a problem we have recently attempted to solve. In extreme cases, where small data sets are used to characterize complex communities, misleading inferences can arise. For instance, random variation can be frequently mistaken for real differences in comparisons of metagenomic data sets with extreme differences in coverage. Further, insufficient coverage also reduces the detection limits and statistical power of the comparisons, hiding real, ecologically relevant trends and differences (Figure 1). We demonstrate here how available solutions can determine the level of sequencing coverage obtained by metagenomic data sets and thus, guide their robust analysis and comparison.

    The amount of host DNA poses a major challenge to metagenome analysis. However, there is no guidance on the levels of host DNA, nor on the depth of sequencing needed to acquire meaningful information from whole metagenome sequencing (WMS). Here, we evaluated the impact of a wide range of amounts of host DNA and sequencing depths on microbiome taxonomic profiling using WMS. Synthetic samples with increasing levels of host DNA were created by spiking DNA of a mock bacterial community, with DNA from a mouse-derived cell line. Taxonomic analysis revealed that increasing proportions of host DNA led to decreased sensitivity in detecting very low and low abundant species. Reduction of sequencing depth had major impact on the sensitivity of WMS for profiling samples with 90% host DNA, increasing the number of undetected species. Finally, analysis of simulated datasets with fixed depth of 10 million reads confirmed that microbiome profiling becomes more inaccurate as the level of host DNA increases in a sample. In conclusion, samples with high amounts of host DNA coupled with reduced sequencing depths, decrease WMS coverage for characterization of the microbiome. This study highlights the importance of carefully considering these aspects in the design of WMS experiments to maximize microbiome analyses.

    Shotgun metagenomics sequencing is a powerful tool for the characterization of complex biological matrices, enabling analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and viruses in a single experiment, with the possibility of reconstructing de novo the whole metagenome or a set of genes of interest. 
    One of the main factors limiting the use of shotgun metagenomics on wide scale projects is the high cost associated with the approach. 
    We set out to determine if it is possible to use shallow shotgun metagenomics to characterize complex biological matrices while reducing costs. 
    We used a staggered mock community to estimate the optimal threshold for species detection. 
    We measured the variation of several summary statistics simulating a decrease in sequencing depth by randomly subsampling a number of reads. 
    The main statistics that were compared are diversity estimates, species abundance, and ability of reconstructing de novo the metagenome in terms of length and completeness. 
    Our results show that diversity indices of complex prokaryotic, eukaryotic and viral communities can be accurately estimated with 500,000 reads or less, although particularly complex samples may require 1,000,000 reads. 
    On the contrary, any task involving the reconstruction of the metagenome performed poorly, even with the largest simulated subsample (1,000,000 reads). 
    The length of the reconstructed assembly was smaller than the length obtained with the full dataset, and the proportion of conserved genes that were identified in the meta-genome was drastically reduced compared to the full sample. 
    Shallow shotgun metagenomics can be a useful tool to describe the structure of complex matrices, but it is not adequate to reconstruct—even partially—the metagenome.

    In the present study, we compared the ability of varying sequencing depths to generate meaningful information about the taxonomic structure and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the bovine fecal microbial community. 
    Metagenomic sequencing was conducted on eight composite fecal samples originating from four beef cattle feedlots. 
    Metagenomic DNA was sequenced to various depths, D1, D0.5 and D0.25, with average sample read counts of 117, 59 and 26 million, respectively. 
    A comparative analysis of the relative abundance of reads aligning to different phyla and antimicrobial classes indicated that the relative proportions of read assignments remained fairly constant regardless of depth. 
    However, the number of reads being assigned to ARGs as well as to microbial taxa increased significantly with increasing depth. We found a depth of D0.5 was suitable to describe the microbiome and resistome of cattle fecal samples. 
    This study helps define a balance between cost and required sequencing depth to acquire meaningful results.

    Background
    Shotgun metagenomics is increasingly used to characterise microbial communities, particularly for the investigation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in different animal and environmental contexts. 
    There are many different approaches for inferring the taxonomic composition and AMR gene content of complex community samples from shotgun metagenomic data, but there has been little work establishing the optimum sequencing depth, data processing and analysis methods for these samples. 
    In this study we used shotgun metagenomics and sequencing of cultured isolates from the same samples to address these issues. 
    We sampled three potential environmental AMR gene reservoirs (pig caeca, river sediment, effluent) and sequenced samples with shotgun metagenomics at high depth (~ 200 million reads per sample). 
    Alongside this, we cultured single-colony isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the same samples and used hybrid sequencing (short- and long-reads) to create high-quality assemblies for comparison to the metagenomic data. 
    To automate data processing, we developed an open-source software pipeline, ‘ResPipe’.
    
    Results
    Taxonomic profiling was much more stable to sequencing depth than AMR gene content. 
    1 million reads per sample was sufficient to achieve < 1% dissimilarity to the full taxonomic composition. 
    However, at least 80 million reads per sample were required to recover the full richness of different AMR gene families present in the sample, and additional allelic diversity of AMR genes was still being discovered in effluent at 200 million reads per sample. 
    Normalising the number of reads mapping to AMR genes using gene length and an exogenous spike of Thermus thermophilus DNA substantially changed the estimated gene abundance distributions. 
    While the majority of genomic content from cultured isolates from effluent was recoverable using shotgun metagenomics, this was not the case for pig caeca or river sediment.

    Conclusions
    Sequencing depth and profiling method can critically affect the profiling of polymicrobial animal and environmental samples with shotgun metagenomics. 
    Both sequencing of cultured isolates and shotgun metagenomics can recover substantial diversity that is not identified using the other methods. 
    Particular consideration is required when inferring AMR gene content or presence by mapping metagenomic reads to a database.

    Due to the massive quantity and broad phylogeny, an accurate measurement of microbial diversity is highly challenging in soil ecosystems. 
    Initially, the deviation caused by sampling should be adequately considered. 
    Here, we attempted to uncover the effect of different sampling strategies on α diversity measurement of soil prokaryotes. 
    Four 1 m2 sampling quadrats in a typical grassland were thoroughly surveyed through deep 16S rRNA gene sequencing (over 11 million reads per quadrat) with numerous replicates (33 soil sampling cores with total 141 replicates per quadrat). 
    We found the difference in diversity was relatively small when pooling soil cores before and after DNA extraction and sequencing, but they were both superior to a non-pooling strategy. 
    Pooling a small number of soil cores (i.e., 5 or 9) combined with several technical replicates is sufficient to estimate diversities for soil prokaryotes, and there is great flexibility in pooling original samples or data at different experimental steps. 
    Additionally, the distribution of local α diversity varies with sampling core number, sequencing depth, and abundance distribution of the community, especially for high orders of Hill diversity index (i.e., Shannon entropy and inverse Simpson index). 
    For each grassland soil quadrat (1 m2), retaining 100,000 reads after taxonomic clustering might be a realistic option, as these number of reads can efficiently cover the majority of common species in this area. 
    Our findings provide important guidance for soil sampling strategy, and the general results can serve as a basis for further studies.

    ABSTRACT
    Although microbial communities are associated with human, environmental, plant, and animal health, there exists no cost-effective method for precisely characterizing species and genes in such communities. 
    While deep whole-metagenome shotgun (WMS) sequencing provides high taxonomic and functional resolution, it is often prohibitively expensive for large-scale studies. 
    The prevailing alternative, 16S rRNA gene amplicon (16S) sequencing, often does not resolve taxonomy past the genus level and provides only moderately accurate predictions of the functional profile; thus, there is currently no widely accepted approach to affordable, high-resolution, taxonomic, and functional microbiome analysis. 
    To address this technology gap, we evaluated the information content of shallow shotgun sequencing with as low as 0.5 million sequences per sample as an alternative to 16S sequencing for large human microbiome studies. 
    We describe a library preparation protocol enabling shallow shotgun sequencing at approximately the same per-sample cost as 16S sequencing. 
    We analyzed multiple real and simulated biological data sets, including two novel human stool samples with ultradeep sequencing of 2.5 billion sequences per sample, and found that shallow shotgun sequencing recovers more-accurate species-level taxonomic and functional profiles of the human microbiome than 16S sequencing. 
    We discuss the inherent limitations of shallow shotgun sequencing and note that 16S sequencing remains a valuable and important method for taxonomic profiling of novel environments. 
    Although deep WMS sequencing remains the gold standard for high-resolution microbiome analysis, we recommend that researchers consider shallow shotgun sequencing as a useful alternative to 16S sequencing for large-scale human microbiome research studies where WMS sequencing may be cost-prohibitive.

    IMPORTANCE 
    A common refrain in recent microbiome-related academic meetings is that the field needs to move away from broad taxonomic surveys using 16S sequencing and toward more powerful longitudinal studies using shotgun sequencing. 
    However, performing deep shotgun sequencing in large longitudinal studies remains prohibitively expensive for all but the most well-funded research labs and consortia, which leads many researchers to choose 16S sequencing for large studies, followed by deep shotgun sequencing on a subset of targeted samples. 
    Here, we show that shallow- or moderate-depth shotgun sequencing may be used by researchers to obtain species-level taxonomic and functional data at approximately the same cost as amplicon sequencing. 
    While shallow shotgun sequencing is not intended to replace deep shotgun sequencing for strain-level characterization, we recommend that microbiome scientists consider using shallow shotgun sequencing instead of 16S sequencing for large-scale human microbiome studies.

    With the growing capacity to inventory microbial community diversity, the need for statistical methods to compare community inventories is also growing. 
    Several approaches have been proposed for comparing the diversity of microbial communities: some adapted from traditional ecology and others designed specifically for molecular inventories of microbes. 
    Rarefaction is one statistical method that is commonly applied in microbial studies, and this chapter discusses the procedure and its advantages and disadvantages. 
    Rarefaction compares observed taxon richness at a standardized sampling effort using confidence intervals. 
    Special emphasis is placed here on the need for precise, rather than unbiased, estimation methods in microbial ecology, but precision can be judged only with a very large sample or with multiple samples drawn from a single community. 
    With low sample sizes, rarefaction curves also have the potential to lead to incorrect rankings of relative species richness, but this chapter discusses a new method with the potential to address this problem. 
    Finally, this chapter shows how rarefaction can be applied to the comparison of the taxonomic similarity of microbial communities.

    Background

Improving knowledge of biodiversity will benefit conservation biology, enhance bioremediation studies, and could lead to new medical treatments. However there is no standard approach to estimate and to compare the diversity of different environments, or to study its past, and possibly, future evolution.
Presentation of the hypothesis

We argue that there are two conditions for significant progress in the identification and quantification of biodiversity. First, integrative metagenomic studies - aiming at the simultaneous examination (or even better at the integration) of observations about the elements, functions and evolutionary processes captured by the massive sequencing of multiple markers - should be preferred over DNA barcoding projects and over metagenomic projects based on a single marker. Second, such metagenomic data should be studied with novel inclusive network-based approaches, designed to draw inferences both on the many units and on the many processes present in the environments.
Testing the hypothesis

We reached these conclusions through a comparison of the theoretical foundations of two molecular approaches seeking to assess biodiversity: metagenomics (mostly used on prokaryotes and protists) and DNA barcoding (mostly used on multicellular eukaryotes), and by pragmatic considerations of the issues caused by the 'species problem' in biodiversity studies.
Implications of the hypothesis

Evolutionary gene networks reduce the risk of producing biodiversity estimates with limited explanatory power, biased either by unequal rates of LGT, or difficult to interpret due to (practical) problems caused by type I and type II grey zones. Moreover, these networks would easily accommodate additional (meta)transcriptomic and (meta)proteomic data.

    The first step of any metagenome sequencing project is to get the inventory of OTU abundances (operational taxonomic units) and/or metagenomic gene abundances. 
    The former is generated with 16S-rRNA-tagged amplicon sequencing technology, and the latter can be generated from either gene-targeted or whole-sample shotgun metagenomics technologies. 
    With 16S-rRNA data sets, measuring community diversity with diversity indexes such as species richness and Shannon's index has been a de facto standard analysis; nevertheless, similarly comprehensive approaches to metagenomic gene abundances are still largely missing, despite that both OTU and gene abundances are DNA reads. 
    Here, we adapt the Hill numbers, which were reintroduced to macrocommunity ecology recently and are now widely regarded as a most appropriate measure system for ecological diversity, for measuring metagenome alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversities, and similarity. 
    Our proposal includes the following: (a) Metagenomic gene (MG) diversity measures the single-gene-level metagenome diversity; (b) Type-I metagenome functional gene cluster (MFGC) diversity measures the diversity of functional gene clusters but ignoring within-cluster gene abundance information; (c) Type-II MFGC diversity considers within-cluster gene abundances information and integrates gene-cluster-level metagenome diversity and functional gene redundancy information; and (d) Four classes of Hill-numbers-based similarity metrics, including local gene overlap, regional gene overlap, gene homogeneity measure and gene turnover complement, were introduced in terms of MG and MFGC, respectively. 
    We demonstrate the proposal with the gut metagenomes from healthy and IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) cohorts. 
    The Hill numbers offer a unified approach to cohesively and comprehensively measuring the ecological and metagenome diversities of microbiomes.

The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA is employed in studies of fungi (Nilsson et al. 2008). Plant DNA barcoding has relied heavily upon regions of plastid DNA including maturase K (matK) and ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcl) (CBOL Plant Working Group 2009; Burgess et al. 2011). A number of other marker genes have been employed for biodiversity analysis at different phylogenetic depths or in certain taxonomic groups.
