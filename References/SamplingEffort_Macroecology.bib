    While conservation planning requires good biodiversity data, our knowledge of most
    living groups is scarce and patchy even in well-sampled regions. 
    Therefore, we need methodologies for rapid assessments for particular groups and regions. 
    Maps of any biodiversity surrogate can be interpolated from even a few well-known sites, but such places are usually lacking. 
    We therefore propose a protocol for designing field surveys to obtain good coverage of pattern variations of biodiversity in a given region. 
    To represent biodiversity patterns comprehensively, we use a rule step site-allocation procedure, partially based on Faith and Walker’s ED criterion that takes environmental and spatial variation into account, together with other criteria such as survey costs.
    A preliminary assessment of the adequacy of this site sampling strategy is made. 
    Then a set of complementary sites is selected for further sampling. 
    Using the ED criterion, during the stepwise process a p-median analysis is applied both to an environmental distance matrix and to a spatial distance matrix, to maximize the amount of variation covered by our survey planning. 
    This rule-set allocation procedure is integrated into a continuous sampling design protocol directed to ensure we can sample all biodiversity of a region. 
    This protocol requires the gathering of both biological and environmental information, an assessment of previously available information, the choice of sampling methods and dates, and a continuous assessment of the success of the survey being carried out. 
    An example of the application of this protocol to the survey design of dung beetle (Coleoptera,
    Scarabaeoidea) diversity in the Comunidad de Madrid (Spain) is included.

  abstract = {
    In this study we used species accumulation models to solve one of the most serious problems encountered when comparing species richness between different communities.
    The problem is how to compare data among inventories in which different methodologies or measures of sampling effort have been employed. 
    The methods used here for bats may be applied to any other biological group. 
    We fit two asymptotic models to species accumulation curves for bat inventories to evaluate local or within-community diversity (alpha) and landscape diversity (gamma) in central Veracruz, Mexico.

    Species accumulation models allow us to: (i) measure within-inventory efficacy and completeness; (ii) obtain an estimate of species richness that is based on a standardized measure of sampling effort, which makes valid comparisons between inventories possible; and (iii) estimate the minimum sampling effort required to reach a satisfactory level of completeness.

    The applied models fit well in all cases (r^2 > 0.95). 
    The linear dependence model predicted lower asymptotes and the Clench model predicted higher asymptotes than the observed species richness. 
    These models are useful as predictors representing the lower and upper limits between which the true species richness value should lie.

    Alpha diversity for bats in all vegetation communities (11–18 species) was lower than the gamma diversity (20 species), suggesting that species richness and the sampling effort required are related to environmental heterogeneity.

    We propose that 90% of the total fauna predicted by either of the models is an acceptable standardized value for comparing species richness between communities.

    We assessed the within-inventory completeness as the proportion of the models’ asymptote, where 90% is the desired minimum level of completeness. 
    Except in palm stands, all bat inventories had an acceptable level of completeness, at least for the linear dependence model.

    For conditions similar to those of our study area, the minimum effort required to obtain a satisfactory level of completeness is 5–18 nights for plant communities and 18 nights for more heterogeneous landscapes.

    We make recommendations for improving the efficacy and completeness of bat surveys based on the application of species accumulation models.

    The selection of the most appropriate model is essential to predict the potential species richness of a site or landscape. 
    Species accumulation curves have been used as a basic tool for comparing richness when different sampling protocols have been applied. 
    Among the parameters generated by these models the slope has been cited as an indicator of completeness without regard to a defined cut-off value. 
    In this work, we fit 12 field data sets of aquatic Coleoptera (Hidalgo) and Odonata larvae (Michoacán) to 2 asymptotic models (Clench and Linear Dependence) in order to calculate the slopes at the maximum effort and relate them with efficiency. 
    Then, the theoretical effort needed to achieve the 95% of the lists was calculated for each data set in order to get the theoretical slopes. 
    The average slope value found was 0.01 with a variance of <0.001, so we propose this value as indicative of a list reaching 95% of completeness for data obtained from similar sampling protocols. 
    Additionally, we propose the use of number of rare species as an additional criterion to evaluate the inventories completeness. 
    The effect of different sampling intensity on fitted models and estimation of parameters and the importance of a cut-off slope value in asymptotic models as a criterion to evaluate completeness of biological inventories are discussed.

  abstract = {
    We propose an integrated sampling, rarefaction, and extrapolation methodology to compare species richness of a set of communities based on samples of equal completeness (as measured by sample coverage) instead of equal size. 
    Traditional rarefaction or extrapolation to equal-sized samples can misrepresent the relationships between the richnesses of the communities being compared because a sample of a given size may be sufficient to fully characterize the lower diversity community, but insufficient to characterize the richer community. 
    Thus, the traditional method systematically biases the degree of differences between community richnesses. 
    We derived a new analytic method for seamless coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation. 
    We show that this method yields less biased comparisons of richness between communities, and manages this with less total sampling effort. 
    When this approach is integrated with an adaptive coverage-based stopping rule during sampling, samples may be compared directly without rarefaction, so no extra data is taken and none is thrown away. 
    Even if this stopping rule is not used during data collection, coverage-based rarefaction throws away less data than traditional size-based rarefaction, and more efficiently finds the correct ranking of communities according to their true richnesses. 
    Several hypothetical and real examples demonstrate these advantages.

  abstract = {
    Changes in biodiversity today shape the future patterns of biodiversity. 
    This fact underlines the importance of understanding changes in biodiversity through time and space. 
    The number of species, known as species richness, has long been studied as a key indicator that quantifies the state of biodiversity, and standardisation techniques, called rarefaction, have also been used to undertake a fair comparison of the richness observed at different times or locations. 
    The present study asks whether utilising different rarefaction techniques attains comparable results when investigating changes in species richness. 
    The study framework presents the statistical nature of two commonly adopted rarefaction techniques: size-based and coverage-based rarefaction. 
    The key finding is that the rarefied richness results calculated by these two different rarefaction methods reflect different aspects of biodiversity change, the shift in community size and/or composition. 
    This fact illuminates that richness analyses based on different rarefaction techniques can reach different conclusions that may be contradictory. 
    The study also investigates the mechanism creating such divergence. 
    As such, special care is required when evaluating biodiversity change using species richness as an indicator.

    Species richness (the number of species) in an assemblage is a key metric in many research fields of ecology. 
    Simple counts of species in samples typically underestimate the true species richness and strongly depend on sampling effort and sample completeness. 
    Based on possibly unequal-sampling effort and incomplete samples that miss many species, there are two approaches to infer species richness and make fair comparisons among multiple assemblages,: (1) An asymptotic approach via species richness estimation. 
    This approach aims to compare species richness estimates across assemblages. 
    We focus on the nonparametric estimators that are universally valid for all species abundance distributions. 
    (2) A non-asymptotic approach via the sample-size- and coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation on the basis of standardised sample size or sample completeness (as measured by sample coverage). 
    This approach aims to compare species richness estimates for equally large or equally complete samples. 
    Two R packages (SpadeR and iNEXT) are applied to beetle data for illustration.

    We explain how species accumulation curves are influenced by species richness (total number of species), relative abundance and diversity using computer-generated simulations. 
    Species richness defines the boundary of the horizontal asymptote value for a species accumulation curve, and the shape of the curve is influenced by both relative abundance and diversity. 
    Simulations with a high proportion of rare species and a few abundant species have a species accumulation curve with a low ‘shoulder’ (inflection point on the ordinate axis) and a long upward slope to the asymptote. 
    Simulations with a high proportion of relatively abundant species have a steeply rising initial slope to the species accumulation curve and plateau early. 
    Diversity (as measured by Simpson's and Shannon–Weaver indices) for simulations is positively correlated with the initial slope of the species accumulation curve. 
    Species accumulation curves cross when one simulation has a high proportion of both rare and abundant species compared with another that has a more even distribution of abundance among species.

  abstract = {
    The compositional complexity of an assemblage is not expressible as a single number; standard measures such as diversities (Hill numbers) and entropies (Rényi entropies and Tsallis entropies) vary in their order q which determines the measures' emphasis on rare or common species. Ranking and comparing assemblages depend on the choice of q. Rather than selecting one or a few measures to describe an assemblage, it is preferable to convey the complete story by presenting a continuous profile, a plot of diversity or entropy as a function of q ≥ 0. This makes it easy to visually compare the compositional complexities of multiple assemblages and to judge the evenness of the relative abundance distributions of the assemblages. In practice, the profile is plotted for all values of q from 0 to q = 3 or 4 (beyond which it generally changes little).
    These profiles are usually generated by substituting species sample proportions into the complexity measures. However, this empirical approach typically underestimates the true profile for low values of q, because samples usually miss some of the assemblage's species due to under-sampling. Although bias-reduction methods exist for individual measures of order q = 0, 1 and 2, there has been no analytic method that unifies these bias-corrected estimates into a continuous profile.
    For incomplete sampling data, this work proposes a novel analytic method to obtain accurate, continuous, low-bias diversity and entropy profiles with focus on low orders of q (0 ≤ q ≤ 3). Our approach is based on reformulating the diversity and entropy of any order q in terms of the successive discovery rates of new species with respect to sample size, that is the successive slopes of the species accumulation curve. A bootstrap method is applied to obtain approximate variances of our proposed profiles and to construct the associated confidence intervals.
    Extensive simulations from theoretical models and real surveys show that the proposed profiles greatly reduce under-sampling bias and have substantially lower bias and mean-squared error than the empirical profile, especially for q ≤ 1. Our method is also extended to deal with incidence data.

1. Measuring biodiversity quantitatively is a key component to its investigation, but many methods are known to be biased by undersampling (i.e. incomplete inventories), a common situation in ecological field studies.

2. Following a long tradition of comparing measures of alpha diversity to judge their usefulness, we used simulated data to assess bias of nine diversity measures – some of them proposed fairly recently, such as estimating true species richness depending on the completeness of inventories (Brose, U. & Martinez, N.D. Oikos (2004) 105, 292), bias-corrected Shannon diversity (Chao, A. & Shen, T.-J. Environmental and Ecological Statistics (2003) 10, 429), while others are commonly applied (e.g. Shannon’s entropy, Fisher’s α) or long known but rarely used (estimating Shannon’s entropy from Fisher’s α).

3. We conclude that the ‘effective number of species’ based on bias-corrected Shannon’s entropy is an unbiased estimator of diversity at sample completeness c. >0·5, while below that it is still less biased than, e.g., estimated species richness (Brose, U. & Martinez, N.D. Oikos (2004) 105, 292).

4. Fisher’s α cannot be tested with the same rigour because it cannot measure the diversity of completely inventoried communities, and we present simulations illustrating this effect when sample completeness approaches high values. However, we can show that Fisher’s α produces relatively stable values at low sample completeness (an effect previously shown only in empirical data), and we tentatively conclude that it may still be considered a good (possibly superior) measure of diversity if completeness is very low.

    In this paper a methodology is presented for measuring diversity based on rarefaction of actual samples. By the use of this technique, a within-habitat analysis was made of the bivalve and polychaete components of soft-bottom marine faunas which differed in latitude, depth, temperature, and salinity. The resulting diversity values were highly correlated with the physical stability and past history of these environments. A stability-time hypothesis was invoked to fit these findings, and, with this hypothesis, predictions were made about the diversities present in certain other environments as yet unstudied. The two types of diversity, based on numerical percentage composition and on number of species, were compared and shown to be poorly correlated with each other. Our data indicated that species number is the more valid diversity measurement. The rarefaction methodology was compared with a number of diversity indexes using identical data. Many of these indexes were markedly influenced by sample size. Good agreement was found between the rarefaction methodology and the Shannon-Wiener information function.

    The recent literature on species diversity contains many semantic, conceptual, and technical problems. It is suggested that, as a result of these problems, species diversity has become a meaningless concept, that the term be abandoned, and that ecologists take a more critical approach to species—number relations and rely less on information theoretic and other analogies. As multispecific collections of organisms possess numerous statistical properties which conform to the conventional criteria for diversity indices, such collections are not intrinsically arrangeable in linear order along some diversity scale. Several such properties or "species composition parameters" having straightforward biological interpretations are presented as alternatives to the diversity approach. The two most basic of these are simply ▵1=[n/n—1][1—Σi(N_i/_N)2] =the proportion of potential interindividual encounters which is interspecific (as opposed to intraspecific), assuming every individual in the collection can encounter all other individuals, E(Sn) = Σi [1—(N—Nin)/(Nn)] =the expected number of species in a sample of n individuals selected at random from a collection containing N individuals, S species, and Ni individuals in the ith species.

    Fish species richness is an important indicator of river ecological condition but it is particularly difficult to estimate in large unwadeable rapidly flowing rivers. Intensive multi-gear sampling is time consuming, logistically complex and expensive. However, insufficient sampling effort underestimates species richness and yields inaccurate data about the ecological condition of river sites. We raft-electrofished 10 large river sites in 10 different ecoregions and six western USA states for distances equal to 300 times their mean wetted channel widths (MCWs) to estimate the effort needed to approach asymptotes in fish species richness. To collect 90% of the observed fish species at the sites, we found that an average of 150 MCWs (ranging 80–210 MCWs) were needed, with the number of MCWs increasing in rivers with a higher proportion of spatially rare species. Frequently, the second or third additional 100 MCWs produced only one or two additional singletons or doubletons (species occurring only once or twice at a site). Before initiating sampling programs for estimating species richness, we recommend assessing sampling effort, particularly if rare or uncommon species are expected or desired.

    A three-step protocol described elsewhere is used to obtain a map of butterfly species density in Portugal on a 50×50 km grid. First, all available faunistic information was compiled and analysed to explore the historic patterns of butterfly sampling in Portugal, and to determine which grid cells are sufficiently prospected to produce reliable estimates of species richness. Then, we relate the estimated species richness scores from these areas to a set of environmental and spatial variables by means of General Linear Models, obtaining a function to extrapolate of species density scores to the rest of Portugal. Finally, the model is validated, results explored and outliers identified and deleted. Any spatial autocorrelation remaining in the residuals is examined. Lastly, model parameters are recalculated in absence of deleted outliers, and the resulting function is used to predict species richness scores throughout mainland Portugal. A highly-predictive function based on some variables previously related to butterfly composition at macro-scale, such as number of sunny days per year, temperature or environmental heterogeneity, was obtained. However, in Portugal those variables are highly spatially structured along a steep latitudinal gradient, leading to difficulty in ascertaining if the latitudinal gradient detected by our analysis is due to macroecological or historic effects. Information on European and Iberian butterfly assemblages and causal processes are discussed in the light of the patterns observed. Then, previous information obtained on Portuguese scarabs is added to identify conservation areas, biogeographically important for both insect groups. Finally, the main drawbacks and advantages of this approach to mapping biodiversity for conservation are discussed briefly.

    With the growing capacity to inventory microbial community diversity, the need for statistical methods to compare community inventories is also growing. Several approaches have been proposed for comparing the diversity of microbial communities: some adapted from traditional ecology and others designed specifically for molecular inventories of microbes. Rarefaction is one statistical method that is commonly applied in microbial studies, and this chapter discusses the procedure and its advantages and disadvantages. Rarefaction compares observed taxon richness at a standardized sampling effort using confidence intervals. Special emphasis is placed here on the need for precise, rather than unbiased, estimation methods in microbial ecology, but precision can be judged only with a very large sample or with multiple samples drawn from a single community. With low sample sizes, rarefaction curves also have the potential to lead to incorrect rankings of relative species richness, but this chapter discusses a new method with the potential to address this problem. Finally, this chapter shows how rarefaction can be applied to the comparison of the taxonomic similarity of microbial communities.
