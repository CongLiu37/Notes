    The human endogenous intestinal microflora is an essential “organ” in providing nourishment, regulating epithelial development, and instructing innate immunity; yet, surprisingly, basic features remain poorly described. 
    We examined 13,355 prokaryotic ribosomal RNA gene sequences from multiple colonic mucosal sites and feces of healthy subjects to improve our understanding of gut microbial diversity. 
    A majority of the bacterial sequences corresponded to uncultivated species and novel microorganisms. 
    We discovered significant intersubject variability and differences between stool and mucosa community composition. 
    Characterization of this immensely diverse ecosystem is the first step in elucidating its role in health and disease.

    Over the past 20 years, more than 78,000 16S rRNA gene sequences have been deposited in GenBank and the Ribosomal Database Project, making the 16S rRNA gene the most widely studied gene for reconstructing bacterial phylogeny. 
    While there is a general appreciation that these sequences are largely unique and derived from diverse species of bacteria, there has not been a quantitative attempt to describe the extent of sequencing efforts to date. 
    We constructed rarefaction curves for each bacterial phylum and for the entire bacterial domain to assess the current state of sampling and the relative taxonomic richness of each phylum. 
    This analysis quantifies the general sense among microbiologists that we are a long way from a complete census of the bacteria on Earth. 
    Moreover, the analysis indicates that current sampling strategies might not be the most effective ones to describe novel diversity because there remain numerous phyla that are globally distributed yet poorly sampled. 
    Based on the current level of sampling, it is not possible to estimate the total number of bacterial species on Earth, but the minimum species richness is 35,498. 
    Considering previous global species richness estimates of 107 to 109, we are certain that this estimate will increase with additional sequencing efforts. 
    The data support previous calls for extensive surveys of multiple chemically disparate environments and of specific phylogenetic groups to advance the census most rapidly.

    The taxonomic diversity of the microbial communities associated with stable 30-y old cheese brines from an artisan and large-scale cheese producer located in Flanders, Belgium, was investigated culture-independently. 
    High-throughput amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed species of Tetragenococcus, Chromohalobacter, and Halanaerobium as the most abundant ones in both brines. 
    Debaryomyces was the only yeast genus detected. 
    All these halophiles might originate from the salt used and might survive and even grow in the brines. 
    The occurrence of different and/or additional species in the two brines could be due to differences in salt concentrations. 
    A second group of microorganisms, possibly incapable of growth in the brines, could be mainly associated with the cheese production ingredients, such as the rennet (Lactobacillus rennini), starter culture (Lactococcus lactis) or raw milk used (Lc. lactis and Staphylococcus equorum). 
    This specific brine microbiota might have an impact on the ultimate quality of the cheeses produced.

      Analysis of human body microbial diversity is fundamental to understanding community structure, biology and ecology. 
      The National Institutes of Health Human Microbiome Project (HMP) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine microbial diversity within and across body habitats and individuals through pyrosequencing-based profiling of 16 S rRNA gene sequences (16 S) from habits of the oral, skin, distal gut, and vaginal body regions from over 200 healthy individuals enabling the application of statistical techniques. 
      In this study, two approaches were applied to elucidate the nature and extent of human microbiome diversity. 
      First, bootstrap and parametric curve fitting techniques were evaluated to estimate the maximum number of unique taxa, Smax, and taxa discovery rate for habitats across individuals. 
      Next, our results demonstrated that the variation of diversity within low abundant taxa across habitats and individuals was not sufficiently quantified with standard ecological diversity indices. 
      This impact from low abundant taxa motivated us to introduce a novel rank-based diversity measure, the Tail statistic, (“τ”), based on the standard deviation of the rank abundance curve if made symmetric by reflection around the most abundant taxon. 
      Due to τ’s greater sensitivity to low abundant taxa, its application to diversity estimation of taxonomic units using taxonomic dependent and independent methods revealed a greater range of values recovered between individuals versus body habitats, and different patterns of diversity within habitats. 
      The greatest range of τ values within and across individuals was found in stool, which also exhibited the most undiscovered taxa. 
      Oral and skin habitats revealed variable diversity patterns, while vaginal habitats were consistently the least diverse. 
      Collectively, these results demonstrate the importance, and motivate the introduction, of several visualization and analysis methods tuned specifically for next-generation sequence data, further revealing that low abundant taxa serve as an important reservoir of genetic diversity in the human microbiome.

    The ongoing revolution in high-throughput sequencing continues to democratize the ability of small groups of investigators to map the microbial component of the biosphere. 
    In particular, the coevolution of new sequencing platforms and new software tools allows data acquisition and analysis on an unprecedented scale. 
    Here we report the next stage in this coevolutionary arms race, using the Illumina GAIIx platform to sequence a diverse array of 25 environmental samples and three known “mock communities” at a depth averaging 3.1 million reads per sample. 
    We demonstrate excellent consistency in taxonomic recovery and recapture diversity patterns that were previously reported on the basis of meta-analysis of many studies from the literature (notably, the saline/nonsaline split in environmental samples and the split between host-associated and free-living communities). 
    We also demonstrate that 2,000 Illumina single-end reads are sufficient to recapture the same relationships among samples that we observe with the full dataset. 
    The results thus open up the possibility of conducting large-scale studies analyzing thousands of samples simultaneously to survey microbial communities at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution

    Land-use change has been identified as the most severe threat to biodiversity. 
    Soils are important biodiversity reservoirs, but to what extent conversion of high-altitude temperate forest to arable land affects taxonomic and functional soil biodiversity is still largely unknown. 
    Shotgun metagenomics was used to determine the taxonomic and functional diversity of bacteria, archaea and DNA virus in terms of effective number of species in high-altitude temperate oak and pine-oak forest and arable soils from Mexico. 
    Generally, the soil ecosystem maintained its microbial species richness notwithstanding land-use change. 
    Archaea diversity was not affected by land-use change, but the bacterial diversity decreased with 45–55% when the oak forest was converted to arable land and 65–75% when the pine-oak forest was. 
    Loss in bacterial diversity as a result of land-use change was positively correlated (R2 = 0.41) with the 10–25% loss in functional diversity. 
    The archaeal communities were evener than the bacterial ones, which might explain their different response to land-use change. 
    We expected a decrease in DNA viral communities as the bacterial diversity decreased, i.e. their potential hosts. 
    However, a higher viral diversity was found in the arable than in the forest soils. 
    It was found that converting high altitude oak and pine-oak forests to arable land more than halved the bacterial diversity, but did not affect the archaeal and even increased the viral diversity.

  abstract = {
    The spatial distribution of biodiversity (i.e., the biogeography) of the hot-spring microbiome is critical for understanding the microbial ecosystems in hot springs. 
    We investigated the microbiome diversity scaling (changes) over space by analyzing the diversity-area relationship (DAR), which is an extension to classic SAR (species-area relationship) law in biogeography. 
    We built DAR models for archaea and bacteria with 16S-rRNA sequencing datasets from 165 hot springs globally. 
    From the DAR models, we sketch out the biogeographic maps of hot-spring microbiomes by constructing: (i) DAR profile—measuring the archaea or bacteria diversity scaling over space (areas); (ii) PDO (pair-wise diversity overlap or similarity) profile—estimating the PDO between two hot springs; (iii) MAD (maximal accrual diversity) profile—predicting the global MAD; (iv) LRD/LGD (ratio of local diversity to regional or global diversity) profile. 
    We further investigated the differences between archaea and bacteria in their biogeographic maps. 
    For example, the comparison of DAR-profile maps revealed that the archaea diversity is more heterogeneous (i.e., more diverse) or scaling faster than the bacterial diversity does in terms of species numbers (species richness), but is less heterogeneous (i.e., less diverse) or scaling slower than bacteria when the diversity (Hill numbers) were weighted in favor of more abundant dominant species. 
    When the diversity is weighted equally in terms of species abundances, archaea, and bacteria are equally heterogeneous over space or scaling at the same rate. 
    Finally, unified DAR models (maps) were built with the combined datasets of archaea and bacteria.

    Results of diversity and community ecology studies strongly depend on sampling depth. Completely surveyed communities follow log-normal distribution, whereas power law functions best describe incompletely censused communities. It is arguable whether the statistics behind those theories can be applied to voluminous next generation sequencing data in microbiology by treating individual DNA sequences as counts of molecular taxonomic units (MOTUs). This study addresses the suitability of species abundance models in three groups of plant-associated fungal communities – phyllosphere, ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We tested the impact of differential treatment of molecular singletons on observed and estimated species richness and species abundance distribution models. The arbuscular mycorrhizal community of 48 MOTUs was exhaustively sampled and followed log-normal distribution. The ectomycorrhizal (153 MOTUs) and phyllosphere (327 MOTUs) communities significantly differed from log-normal distribution. The fungal phyllosphere community in particular was clearly undersampled. This undersampling bias resulted in strong sensitivity to the exclusion of molecular singletons and other rare MOTUs that may represent technical artefacts. The analysis of abundant (core) and rare (satellite) MOTUs clearly identified two species abundance distributions in the phyllosphere data – a log-normal model for the core group and a log-series model for the satellite group. The prominent log-series distribution of satellite phyllosphere fungi highlighted the ecological significance of an infrequent fungal component in the phyllosphere community.

    Background
    Insect pests belonging to genus Bactrocera sp. (Diptera: Tephritidae) pose major biotic stress on various fruits and vegetable crops around the world. 
    Zeugodacus and Bactrocera sp. are associated with diverse bacterial communities which play an important role in the fitness of sterile insects. 
    The wild populations of melon fly, Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett) and Oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) were collected from pumpkin and mango fields, respectively. 
    The laboratory populations of Z. cucurbitae and B. dorsalis were mass-reared on bottle gourd and sweet banana, respectively. 
    Bacterial communities present in the gut of wild and mass-reared mature (~ 12 days old) and newly emerged (< 1 h after emergence) male and female adults of Z. cucurbitae and B. dorsalis were assessed. 
    We used Illumina HiSeq next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA gene to profile the gut bacterial communities of wild and mass-reared mature and newly emerged Z. cucurbitae and B. dorsalis adults.
    
    Results
    We found diverse bacterial composition in the gut of wild and mass-reared Z. cucurbitae (ZC) and B. dorsalis (BD) with varied relative abundance. 
    Few taxonomic groups were common to both the species. 
    The most dominant phyla in all samples of Z. cucurbitae and B. dorsalis adults were Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. 
    The phylum Proteobacteria occurred more in wild Z. cucurbitae (~ 87.72%) and B. dorsalis (~ 83.87%) as compared to mass-reared Z. cucurbitae (64.15%) and B. dorsalis (~ 80.96%). 
    Higher relative abundance of Phylum Firmicutes was observed in mass-reared fruit fly than wild adults. 
    Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast and Actinobacteria were also present with very low relative abundance in both wild as well as mass-reared melon fly and Oriental fruit fly. 
    Enterobacteriaceae (61.21%) was dominant family in the gut of both wild and mass-reared adults. 
    Providencia and Lactococcus were dominant genera with varied relative abundance in wild as well as in mass-reared mature and newly emerged fruit fly adults of both species. 
    Some of the genera like Morganella and Serratia were only detected in mass-reared mature and newly emerged Z. cucurbitae and B. dorsalis adults. 
    Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) showed that fruit fly adult samples were grouped based on species and age of the adults while no grouping was observed on the basis of sex of the adult fruit fly.

    Conclusions
    The gut bacterial communities associated with wild and mass-reared mature and newly emerged adults of Z. cucurbitae and B. dorsalis showed variation that depends on species and age of the insects. 
    Understanding the gut microbiota of wild and mass-reared Z. cucurbitae and B. dorsalis using high throughput technology will help to illustrate microbial diversity and this information could be used to develop efficient mass-rearing protocols for successful implementation of sterile insect technique (SIT).

  abstract = {
    Background

Enteric fermentation by farmed ruminant animals is a major source of methane and constitutes the second largest anthropogenic contributor to global warming. Reducing methane emissions from ruminants is needed to ensure sustainable animal production in the future. Methane yield varies naturally in sheep and is a heritable trait that can be used to select animals that yield less methane per unit of feed eaten. We previously demonstrated elevated expression of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway genes of methanogenic archaea in the rumens of high methane yield (HMY) sheep compared to their low methane yield (LMY) counterparts. Methane production in the rumen is strongly connected to microbial hydrogen production through fermentation processes. In this study, we investigate the contribution that rumen bacteria make to methane yield phenotypes in sheep.
Results

Using deep sequence metagenome and metatranscriptome datasets in combination with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from HMY and LMY sheep, we show enrichment of lactate-producing Sharpea spp. in LMY sheep bacterial communities. Increased gene and transcript abundances for sugar import and utilisation and production of lactate, propionate and butyrate were also observed in LMY animals. Sharpea azabuensis and Megasphaera spp. act as important drivers of lactate production and utilisation according to phylogenetic analysis and read mappings.
Conclusions

Our findings show that the rumen microbiome in LMY animals supports a rapid heterofermentative growth, leading to lactate production. We postulate that lactate is subsequently metabolised mainly to butyrate in LMY animals, producing 2 mol of hydrogen and 0.5 mol of methane per mol hexose, which represents 24 % less than the 0.66 mol of methane formed from the 2.66 mol of hydrogen produced if hexose fermentation was directly to acetate and butyrate. These findings are consistent with the theory that a smaller rumen size with a higher turnover rate, where rapid heterofermentative growth would be an advantage, results in lower hydrogen production and lower methane formation. Together with previous methanogen gene expression data, this builds a strong concept of how animal traits and microbial communities shape the methane phenotype in sheep.

    The metagenomes of complex microbial communities are rich sources of novel biocatalysts. We exploited the metagenome of a mixed microbial population for isolation of more than 15 different genes encoding novel biocatalysts by using a combined cultivation and direct cloning strategy. A 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of hitherto uncultured microbes closely related to the genera Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Xanthomonas, Microbulbifer, and Janthinobacterium. Total genomic DNA from this bacterial community was used to construct cosmid DNA libraries, which were functionally searched for novel enzymes of biotechnological value. Our searches in combination with cosmid sequencing resulted in identification of four clones encoding 12 putative agarase genes, most of which were organized in clusters consisting of two or three genes. Interestingly, nine of these agarase genes probably originated from gene duplications. Furthermore, we identified by DNA sequencing several other biocatalyst-encoding genes, including genes encoding a putative stereoselective amidase (amiA), two cellulases (gnuB and uvs080), an α-amylase (amyA), a 1,4-α-glucan branching enzyme (amyB), and two pectate lyases (pelA and uvs119). Also, a conserved cluster of two lipase genes was identified, which was linked to genes encoding a type I secretion system. The novel gene aguB was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the enzyme activities were determined. Finally, we describe more than 162 kb of DNA sequence that provides a strong platform for further characterization of this microbial consortium.

    Large-scale metagenome assemblies of human microbiomes have produced a vast catalogue of previously unseen microbial genomes; however, comparatively few microbial genomes derive from other vertebrates. Here, we generated 5,596 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the gut metagenomes of 180 predominantly wild animal species representing 5 classes, in addition to 14 existing animal gut metagenome data sets. The MAGs comprised 1,522 species-level genome bins (SGBs), most of which were novel at the species, genus, or family level, and the majority were enriched in host versus environment metagenomes. Many traits distinguished SGBs enriched in host or environmental biomes, including the number of antimicrobial resistance genes. We identified 1,986 diverse biosynthetic gene clusters; only 23 clustered with any MIBiG database references. Gene-based assembly revealed tremendous gene diversity, much of it host or environment specific. Our MAG and gene data sets greatly expand the microbial genome repertoire and provide a broad view of microbial adaptations to the vertebrate gut.
