    A ‘metagenome’ is the theoretical collection of genomes from all members of a given microbial community, and a ‘metagenomic data set’ is the subset captured in a given sequencing event. Although these terms are often used interchangeably and metagenomic data sets are regularly called metagenomes by synecdoche, their relationship is analogous to sample and population in statistics. The fraction of the metagenome represented in the metagenomic data set, termed coverage (not to be confused with the repetition of features, termed sequencing depth), is of key importance in assessing statistical significance of features sampled (taxa, genes and so on). However, quantitative computational methods to assess the level of coverage are limited, a problem we have recently attempted to solve. In extreme cases, where small data sets are used to characterize complex communities, misleading inferences can arise. For instance, random variation can be frequently mistaken for real differences in comparisons of metagenomic data sets with extreme differences in coverage. Further, insufficient coverage also reduces the detection limits and statistical power of the comparisons, hiding real, ecologically relevant trends and differences (Figure 1). We demonstrate here how available solutions can determine the level of sequencing coverage obtained by metagenomic data sets and thus, guide their robust analysis and comparison.

    The amount of host DNA poses a major challenge to metagenome analysis. However, there is no guidance on the levels of host DNA, nor on the depth of sequencing needed to acquire meaningful information from whole metagenome sequencing (WMS). Here, we evaluated the impact of a wide range of amounts of host DNA and sequencing depths on microbiome taxonomic profiling using WMS. Synthetic samples with increasing levels of host DNA were created by spiking DNA of a mock bacterial community, with DNA from a mouse-derived cell line. Taxonomic analysis revealed that increasing proportions of host DNA led to decreased sensitivity in detecting very low and low abundant species. Reduction of sequencing depth had major impact on the sensitivity of WMS for profiling samples with 90% host DNA, increasing the number of undetected species. Finally, analysis of simulated datasets with fixed depth of 10 million reads confirmed that microbiome profiling becomes more inaccurate as the level of host DNA increases in a sample. In conclusion, samples with high amounts of host DNA coupled with reduced sequencing depths, decrease WMS coverage for characterization of the microbiome. This study highlights the importance of carefully considering these aspects in the design of WMS experiments to maximize microbiome analyses.

    Shotgun metagenomics sequencing is a powerful tool for the characterization of complex biological matrices, enabling analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and viruses in a single experiment, with the possibility of reconstructing de novo the whole metagenome or a set of genes of interest. 
    One of the main factors limiting the use of shotgun metagenomics on wide scale projects is the high cost associated with the approach. 
    We set out to determine if it is possible to use shallow shotgun metagenomics to characterize complex biological matrices while reducing costs. 
    We used a staggered mock community to estimate the optimal threshold for species detection. 
    We measured the variation of several summary statistics simulating a decrease in sequencing depth by randomly subsampling a number of reads. 
    The main statistics that were compared are diversity estimates, species abundance, and ability of reconstructing de novo the metagenome in terms of length and completeness. 
    Our results show that diversity indices of complex prokaryotic, eukaryotic and viral communities can be accurately estimated with 500,000 reads or less, although particularly complex samples may require 1,000,000 reads. 
    On the contrary, any task involving the reconstruction of the metagenome performed poorly, even with the largest simulated subsample (1,000,000 reads). 
    The length of the reconstructed assembly was smaller than the length obtained with the full dataset, and the proportion of conserved genes that were identified in the meta-genome was drastically reduced compared to the full sample. 
    Shallow shotgun metagenomics can be a useful tool to describe the structure of complex matrices, but it is not adequate to reconstruct—even partially—the metagenome.

    Developments in high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) technology have rapidly advanced the understanding of overall microbial ecology as well as occurrence and diversity of specific genes within diverse environments. 
    In the present study, we compared the ability of varying sequencing depths to generate meaningful information about the taxonomic structure and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the bovine fecal microbial community. 
    Metagenomic sequencing was conducted on eight composite fecal samples originating from four beef cattle feedlots. 
    Metagenomic DNA was sequenced to various depths, D1, D0.5 and D0.25, with average sample read counts of 117, 59 and 26 million, respectively. 
    A comparative analysis of the relative abundance of reads aligning to different phyla and antimicrobial classes indicated that the relative proportions of read assignments remained fairly constant regardless of depth. 
    However, the number of reads being assigned to ARGs as well as to microbial taxa increased significantly with increasing depth. We found a depth of D0.5 was suitable to describe the microbiome and resistome of cattle fecal samples. 
    This study helps define a balance between cost and required sequencing depth to acquire meaningful results.

    Background
    Shotgun metagenomics is increasingly used to characterise microbial communities, particularly for the investigation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in different animal and environmental contexts. 
    There are many different approaches for inferring the taxonomic composition and AMR gene content of complex community samples from shotgun metagenomic data, but there has been little work establishing the optimum sequencing depth, data processing and analysis methods for these samples. 
    In this study we used shotgun metagenomics and sequencing of cultured isolates from the same samples to address these issues. 
    We sampled three potential environmental AMR gene reservoirs (pig caeca, river sediment, effluent) and sequenced samples with shotgun metagenomics at high depth (~ 200 million reads per sample). 
    Alongside this, we cultured single-colony isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the same samples and used hybrid sequencing (short- and long-reads) to create high-quality assemblies for comparison to the metagenomic data. 
    To automate data processing, we developed an open-source software pipeline, ‘ResPipe’.
    
    Results
    Taxonomic profiling was much more stable to sequencing depth than AMR gene content. 
    1 million reads per sample was sufficient to achieve < 1% dissimilarity to the full taxonomic composition. 
    However, at least 80 million reads per sample were required to recover the full richness of different AMR gene families present in the sample, and additional allelic diversity of AMR genes was still being discovered in effluent at 200 million reads per sample. 
    Normalising the number of reads mapping to AMR genes using gene length and an exogenous spike of Thermus thermophilus DNA substantially changed the estimated gene abundance distributions. 
    While the majority of genomic content from cultured isolates from effluent was recoverable using shotgun metagenomics, this was not the case for pig caeca or river sediment.

    Conclusions
    Sequencing depth and profiling method can critically affect the profiling of polymicrobial animal and environmental samples with shotgun metagenomics. 
    Both sequencing of cultured isolates and shotgun metagenomics can recover substantial diversity that is not identified using the other methods. 
    Particular consideration is required when inferring AMR gene content or presence by mapping metagenomic reads to a database. 
    ResPipe, the open-source software pipeline we have developed, is freely available (https://gitlab.com/hsgweon/ResPipe).

    Due to the massive quantity and broad phylogeny, an accurate measurement of microbial diversity is highly challenging in soil ecosystems. 
    Initially, the deviation caused by sampling should be adequately considered. 
    Here, we attempted to uncover the effect of different sampling strategies on α diversity measurement of soil prokaryotes. 
    Four 1 m2 sampling quadrats in a typical grassland were thoroughly surveyed through deep 16S rRNA gene sequencing (over 11 million reads per quadrat) with numerous replicates (33 soil sampling cores with total 141 replicates per quadrat). 
    We found the difference in diversity was relatively small when pooling soil cores before and after DNA extraction and sequencing, but they were both superior to a non-pooling strategy. 
    Pooling a small number of soil cores (i.e., 5 or 9) combined with several technical replicates is sufficient to estimate diversities for soil prokaryotes, and there is great flexibility in pooling original samples or data at different experimental steps. 
    Additionally, the distribution of local α diversity varies with sampling core number, sequencing depth, and abundance distribution of the community, especially for high orders of Hill diversity index (i.e., Shannon entropy and inverse Simpson index). 
    For each grassland soil quadrat (1 m2), retaining 100,000 reads after taxonomic clustering might be a realistic option, as these number of reads can efficiently cover the majority of common species in this area. 
    Our findings provide important guidance for soil sampling strategy, and the general results can serve as a basis for further studies.

    ABSTRACT
    Although microbial communities are associated with human, environmental, plant, and animal health, there exists no cost-effective method for precisely characterizing species and genes in such communities. 
    While deep whole-metagenome shotgun (WMS) sequencing provides high taxonomic and functional resolution, it is often prohibitively expensive for large-scale studies. 
    The prevailing alternative, 16S rRNA gene amplicon (16S) sequencing, often does not resolve taxonomy past the genus level and provides only moderately accurate predictions of the functional profile; thus, there is currently no widely accepted approach to affordable, high-resolution, taxonomic, and functional microbiome analysis. 
    To address this technology gap, we evaluated the information content of shallow shotgun sequencing with as low as 0.5 million sequences per sample as an alternative to 16S sequencing for large human microbiome studies. 
    We describe a library preparation protocol enabling shallow shotgun sequencing at approximately the same per-sample cost as 16S sequencing. 
    We analyzed multiple real and simulated biological data sets, including two novel human stool samples with ultradeep sequencing of 2.5 billion sequences per sample, and found that shallow shotgun sequencing recovers more-accurate species-level taxonomic and functional profiles of the human microbiome than 16S sequencing. 
    We discuss the inherent limitations of shallow shotgun sequencing and note that 16S sequencing remains a valuable and important method for taxonomic profiling of novel environments. 
    Although deep WMS sequencing remains the gold standard for high-resolution microbiome analysis, we recommend that researchers consider shallow shotgun sequencing as a useful alternative to 16S sequencing for large-scale human microbiome research studies where WMS sequencing may be cost-prohibitive.

    IMPORTANCE 
    A common refrain in recent microbiome-related academic meetings is that the field needs to move away from broad taxonomic surveys using 16S sequencing and toward more powerful longitudinal studies using shotgun sequencing. 
    However, performing deep shotgun sequencing in large longitudinal studies remains prohibitively expensive for all but the most well-funded research labs and consortia, which leads many researchers to choose 16S sequencing for large studies, followed by deep shotgun sequencing on a subset of targeted samples. 
    Here, we show that shallow- or moderate-depth shotgun sequencing may be used by researchers to obtain species-level taxonomic and functional data at approximately the same cost as amplicon sequencing. 
    While shallow shotgun sequencing is not intended to replace deep shotgun sequencing for strain-level characterization, we recommend that microbiome scientists consider using shallow shotgun sequencing instead of 16S sequencing for large-scale human microbiome studies.

    With the growing capacity to inventory microbial community diversity, the need for statistical methods to compare community inventories is also growing. 
    Several approaches have been proposed for comparing the diversity of microbial communities: some adapted from traditional ecology and others designed specifically for molecular inventories of microbes. 
    Rarefaction is one statistical method that is commonly applied in microbial studies, and this chapter discusses the procedure and its advantages and disadvantages. 
    Rarefaction compares observed taxon richness at a standardized sampling effort using confidence intervals. 
    Special emphasis is placed here on the need for precise, rather than unbiased, estimation methods in microbial ecology, but precision can be judged only with a very large sample or with multiple samples drawn from a single community. 
    With low sample sizes, rarefaction curves also have the potential to lead to incorrect rankings of relative species richness, but this chapter discusses a new method with the potential to address this problem. 
    Finally, this chapter shows how rarefaction can be applied to the comparison of the taxonomic similarity of microbial communities.
