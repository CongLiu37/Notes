  abstract = {
    Parvoviridae, a diverse family of small single-stranded DNA viruses was established in 1975. It was divided into two subfamilies, Parvovirinae and Densovirinae, in 1993 to accommodate parvoviruses that infect vertebrate and invertebrate animals, respectively. This relatively straightforward segregation, using host association as the prime criterion for subfamily-level classification, has recently been challenged by the discovery of divergent, vertebrate-infecting parvoviruses, dubbed “chapparvoviruses”, which have proven to be more closely related to viruses in certain Densovirinae genera than to members of the Parvovirinae. Viruses belonging to these genera, namely Brevi-, Hepan- and Penstyldensovirus, are responsible for the unmatched heterogeneity of the subfamily Densovirinae when compared to the Parvovirinae in matters of genome organization, protein sequence homology, and phylogeny. Another genus of Densovirinae, Ambidensovirus, has challenged traditional parvovirus classification, as it includes all newly discovered densoviruses with an ambisense genome organization, which introduces genus-level paraphyly. Lastly, current taxon definition and virus inclusion criteria have significantly limited the classification of certain long-discovered parvoviruses and impedes the classification of some potential family members discovered using high-throughput sequencing methods. Here, we present a new and updated system for parvovirus classification, which includes the introduction of a third subfamily, Hamaparvovirinae, resolves the paraphyly within genus Ambidensovirus, and introduces new genera and species into the subfamily Parvovirinae. These proposals were accepted by the ICTV in 2020 March.

    A common and widespread disease of honey bees, Apis mellifera, is caused by an unoccluded, Feulgen-positive, filamentous nuclear virus. Ovoid viral particles seen in diseased bee hemolymph consisted of a folded nucleocapsid within a viral envelope and were 0.40 by 0.10 μm. Virions with unfolded nucleocapsids were about 3060 by 60 nm. The disease was transmissible to bees both per os and by injection, but efforts to infect oriental cockroaches, Blatta orientalis, and the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, failed. The disease is apparently the same as that described as a rickettsial disease of European bees.

    Bees are associated with a remarkable diversity of microorganisms, including unicellular parasites, bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The application of next-generation sequencing approaches enables the identification of this rich species composition as well as the discovery of previously unknown associations. Using high-throughput polyadenylated ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing, we investigated the metatranscriptome of eight wild bee species (Andrena cineraria, Andrena fulva, Andrena haemorrhoa, Bombus terrestris, Bombus cryptarum, Bombus pascuorum, Osmia bicornis, and Osmia cornuta) sampled from four different localities in Belgium. Across the RNA sequencing libraries, 88–99% of the taxonomically informative reads were of the host transcriptome. Four viruses with homology to insect pathogens were found including two RNA viruses (belonging to the families Iflaviridae and Tymoviridae that harbor already viruses of honey bees), a double stranded DNA virus (family Nudiviridae) and a single stranded DNA virus (family Parvoviridae). In addition, we found genomic sequences of 11 unclassified arthropod viruses (related to negeviruses, sobemoviruses, totiviruses, rhabdoviruses, and mononegaviruses), seven plant pathogenic viruses, and one fungal virus. Interestingly, nege-like viruses appear to be widespread, host-specific, and capable of attaining high copy numbers inside bees. Next to viruses, three novel parasite associations were discovered in wild bees, including Crithidia pragensis and a tubulinosematid and a neogregarine parasite. Yeasts of the genus Metschnikowia were identified in solitary bees. This study gives a glimpse of the microorganisms and viruses associated with social and solitary wild bees and demonstrates that their diversity exceeds by far the subset of species first discovered in honey bees.

    Twenty two distinct bacteriophages were isolated from sewage water from five locations in the city of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire over a two-year period, using a collection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains with diverse genotypes. The phages were characterized by their virulence spectrum on a panel of selected P. aeruginosa strains from cystic fibrosis patients and by whole genome sequencing. Twelve virions representing the observed diversity were visualised by electron microscopy. The combined observations showed that 17 phages, distributed into seven genera, were virulent, and that five phages were related to temperate phages belonging to three genera. Some showed similarity with known phages only at the protein level. The vast majority of the genetic variations among virulent phages from the same genus resulted from seemingly non-random horizontal transfer events, inside a population of P. aeruginosa phages with limited diversity. This suggests the existence of a single environmental reservoir or ecotype in which continuous selection is taking place. In contrast, mostly point mutations were observed among phages potentially capable of lysogenisation. This is the first study of P. aeruginosa phage diversity in an African city and it shows that a large variety of phage species can be recovered in a limited geographical site at least when different bacterial strains are used. The relative temporal and spatial stability of the Abidjan phage population might reflect equilibrium in the microbial community from which they are released.

    The honey bee gut microbiota influences bee health and has
become an important model to study the ecology and evolution of
microbiota–host interactions. Yet, little is known about the phage
community associated with the bee gut, despite its potential to
modulate bacterial diversity or to govern important symbiotic func-
tions. Here we analyzed two metagenomes derived from virus-like
particles, analyzed the prevalence of the identified phages across 73
bacterial metagenomes from individual bees, and tested the host
range of isolated phages. Our results show that the honey bee gut
virome is composed of at least 118 distinct clusters corresponding to
both temperate and lytic phages and representing novel genera
with a large repertoire of unknown gene functions. We find that
the phage community is prevalent in honey bees across space and
time and targets the core members of the bee gut microbiota. The
large number and high genetic diversity of the viral clusters seems
to mirror the high extent of strain-level diversity in the bee gut
microbiota. We isolated eight lytic phages that target the core
microbiota member Bifidobacterium asteroides, but that exhibited
different host ranges at the strain level, resulting in a nested in-
teraction network of coexisting phages and bacterial strains. Collec-
tively, our results show that the honey bee gut virome consists of a
complex and diverse phage community that likely plays an impor-
tant role in regulating strain-level diversity in the bee gut and that
holds promise as an experimental model to study bacteria–phage
dynamics in natural microbial communities.

    The gram-positive bacterium Paenibacillus larvae is the etiological agent of American Foulbrood of honey bees, a notifiable disease in many countries. Hence, P. larvae can be considered as an entomopathogen of considerable relevance in veterinary medicine. P. larvae is a highly specialized pathogen with only one established host, the honey bee larva. No other natural environment supporting germination and proliferation of P. larvae is known. Over the last decade, tremendous progress in the understanding of P. larvae and its interactions with honey bee larvae at a molecular level has been made. In this review, we will present the recent highlights and developments in P. larvae research and discuss the impact of some of the findings in a broader context to demonstrate what we can learn from studying “exotic” pathogens.

    We evaluated the antagonistic effects of newly identified lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, originating from the honey stomach, on the honey bee pathogen, Paenibacillus larvae. We used inhibition assays on agar plates and honey bee larval bioassays to investigate the effects of honey bee LAB on P. larvae growth in vitro and on AFB infection in vivo. The individual LAB phylotypes showed different inhibition properties against P. larvae growth on agar plates, whereas a combination of all eleven LAB phylotypes resulted in a total inhibition (no visible growth) of P. larvae. Adding the LAB mixture to the larval food significantly reduced the number of AFB infected larvae in exposure bioassays. The results demonstrate that honey bee specific LAB possess beneficial properties for honey bee health. Possible benefits to honey bee health by enhancing growth of LAB or by applying LAB to honey bee colonies should be further investigated.

    Strain PEB0122T shares >95 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with species of the genus Bartonella, a group of mammalian pathogens transmitted by bloodsucking arthropods. 
    Phylogenetic analyses showed that PEB0122T and related strains from the honey bee gut form a sister clade of the genus Bartonella. 
    Optimal growth of strain PEB0122T was obtained on solid media supplemented with defibrinated sheep blood under microaerophilic conditions at 35–37 °C, which is consistent with the cultural characteristics of other species of the genus Bartonella. 
    Reduced growth of strain PEB0122T also occurred under aerobic conditions. 
    The rod-shaped cells of strain PEB0122T had a mean length of 1.2–1.8 μm and revealed hairy surface structures. 
    Strain PEB0122T was positive for catalase, cytochrome c oxidase, urease and nitrate reductase. 
    The fatty acid composition was comparable to those of other species of the genus Bartonella, with palmitic acid (C16 : 0) and isomers of 18- and 19-carbon chains being the most abundant. 
    The genomic DNA G+C content of PEB0122T was determined to be about 45.5 mol%. The high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with species of Bartonella and its close phylogenetic position suggest that strain PEB0122T represents a novel species within the genus Bartonella, for which we propose the name Bartonella apis sp. nov. The type strain is PEB0122T ( = NCIMB 14961T = DSM 29779T).

    This symbiont is a member of the recently described bacterial order Orbales, which has been collected from the guts of diverse insect species; however, “Ca. Schmidhempelia” has been identified exclusively with bumble bees. 
    Metabolic reconstruction reveals that “Ca. Schmidhempelia” lacks many genes for a functioning NADH dehydrogenase I, all genes for the high-oxygen cytochrome o, and most genes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. 
    “Ca. Schmidhempelia” has retained NADH dehydrogenase II, the low-oxygen specific cytochrome bd, anaerobic nitrate respiration, mixed-acid fermentation pathways, and citrate fermentation, which may be important for survival in low-oxygen or anaerobic environments found in the bee hindgut. 
    Additionally, a type 6 secretion system, a Flp pilus, and many antibiotic/multidrug transporters suggest complex interactions with its host and other gut commensals or pathogens. 
    This genome has signatures of reduction (2.0 megabase pairs) and rearrangement, as previously observed for genomes of host-associated bacteria. 
    A survey of wild and laboratory B. impatiens revealed that “Ca. Schmidhempelia” is present in 90% of individuals and, therefore, may provide benefits to its host.

    Bifidobacteria are known as anaerobic/microaerophilic and fermentative microorganisms, which commonly inhabit the gastrointestinal tract of various animals and insects. 
    Analysis of the 2,167,301 bp genome of Bifidobacterium asteroides PRL2011, a strain isolated from the hindgut of Apis mellifera var. ligustica, commonly known as the honey bee, revealed its predicted capability for respiratory metabolism. 
    Conservation of the latter gene clusters in various B. asteroides strains enforces the notion that respiration is a common metabolic feature of this ancient bifidobacterial species, which has been lost in currently known mammal-derived Bifidobacterium species. 
    In fact, phylogenomic based analyses suggested an ancient origin of B. asteroides and indicates it as an ancestor of the genus Bifidobacterium. 
    Furthermore, the B. asteroides PRL2011 genome encodes various enzymes for coping with toxic products that arise as a result of oxygen-mediated respiration. 
    B. asteroides is capable of metabolizing a broader range of simple carbohydrates than any other tested bifidobacterial species (Fig. S1), many of which (e.g., glucose and fructose) are presumed to be abundant in the honeybee hind gut, representing the natural ecological niche of the B. asteroides species
    Similar to other bifidobacteria, complete biosynthetic pathways for purines and pyrimidines from glutamine, as well as for folate (vitamin B9) were annotated in the genome of B. asteroides PRL2011, while it did not encode known biosynthetic pathways for other B vitamins, such as riboflavin and thiamine, which are also variably distributed in published bifidobacterial genomes. 
    We also found evidence of complete amino acid biosynthetic pathways for most amino acids.

    Parameters that were evaluated included core genome phylogeny, (conserved) pairwise average amino acid identity, clade-specific signature genes, physiological criteria and the ecology of the organisms. 
    Based on this polyphasic approach, we propose reclassification of the genus Lactobacillus into 25 genera including the emended genus Lactobacillus, which includes host-adapted organisms that have been referred to as the Lactobacillus delbrueckii group, Paralactobacillus and 23 novel genera for which the names Holzapfelia , Amylolactobacillus , Bombilactobacillus , Companilactobacillus , Lapidilactobacillus , Agrilactobacillus , Schleiferilactobacillus , Loigolactobacilus , Lacticaseibacillus , Latilactobacillus , Dellaglioa , Liquorilactobacillus , Ligilactobacillus , Lactiplantibacillus , Furfurilactobacillus , Paucilactobacillus , Limosilactobacillus , Fructilactobacillus , Acetilactobacillus , Apilactobacillus , Levilactobacillus , Secundilactobacillus and Lentilactobacillus are proposed.

    The generic term 'lactobacilli' will remain useful to designate all organisms that were classified as Lactobacillaceae until 2020. 
    This reclassification reflects the phylogenetic position of the micro-organisms, and groups lactobacilli into robust clades with shared ecological and metabolic properties, as exemplified for the emended genus Lactobacillus encompassing species adapted to vertebrates (such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii , Lactobacillus iners , Lactobacillus crispatus , Lactobacillus jensensii , Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus acidophilus ) or invertebrates (such as Lactobacillus apis and Lactobacillus bombicola ).

    One hundred and eighty-seven fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase positive strains were isolated from the digestive tract of three different bumblebee species. 
    Analyses of the partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of the representative strains showed only 92.8% and 92.5% similarity to Bifidobacterium coryneforme YIT 4092T and Bifidobacterium indicum JCM 1302T, 92.2% similarity to Alloscardovia omnicolens CCUG 18650 and slightly reduced similarity of 91% to other members of the family Bifidobacteriaceae. 
    On the other hand, analyses of the partial heat-shock protein 60 (hsp60) gene sequence revealed that the proposed type strain BLAPIII-AGVT was affiliated only to the 60 kDa chaperonin sequence of uncultured bacteria from human vagina (79–80%) and the hsp60 gene sequence of A. omnicolens CCUG 31649T (75.5%). 
    The peptidoglycan type was A4α with an l-Lys-d-Asp interpeptide bridge. The polar lipids contained diphosphatidylglycerol, an unknown phospholipid, six glycolipids and two phosphoglycolipids. 
    The major fatty acids were C18:1, C20:0 and C18:0. 
    These and other analyses indicated that the isolates represented a new genus within the family Bifidobacteriaceae. 
    This observation was further substantiated by determination of the DNA G + C contents (46.1–47.1 mol%). 
    Affinity of the strains to some scardovial genera (Aeriscardovia, Alloscardovia and Metascardovia) was also confirmed by their ability to grow under aerobic conditions. 
    Besides the above mentioned differences, Bombiscardovia coagulans was found to differ from all scardovial genera in the ability to grow at temperatures as low as 5 °C, which was another major phenotypically different characteristic of this new member of the family Bifidobacteriaceae. 
    Hence, on the basis of phylogenetic analyses using partial 16S rRNA and hsp60 gene sequence data, and the temperature related phenotypic difference, we propose a novel taxa, B. coagulans gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain = BLAPIII-AGVT = DSM 22924T = ATCC BAA-1568T).

    Ten different versions of the D1/D2 divergent domain of the large-subunit ribosomal DNA were identified among interbreeding members of the yeast species Clavispora lusitaniae. One major polymorphism, located in a 90-bp structural motif of the D2 domain, exists in two versions that differ by 32 base substitutions. Three other polymorphisms consist of a two-base substitution, a two-base deletion, and a single-base deletion, respectively. The polymorphisms are independent of one another and of the two mating types, indicating that the strains studied belong to a single, sexually active Mendelian population. Several strains were heterogeneous for one or more of the polymorphisms, and one strain was found to be automictic and capable of producing asci on its own by isogamous conjugation or by bud–parent autogamy. These observations suggest circumspection in the use of sequence divergence as the principal criterion for delimiting yeast species.
