  abstract = {
    NF-κB transcription factors are critical regulators of immunity, stress responses, apoptosis and differentiation. A variety of stimuli coalesce on NF-κB activation, which can in turn mediate varied transcriptional programs. Consequently, NF-κB-dependent transcription is not only tightly controlled by positive and negative regulatory mechanisms but also closely coordinated with other signaling pathways. This intricate crosstalk is crucial to shaping the diverse biological functions of NF-κB into cell type– and context-specific responses.
