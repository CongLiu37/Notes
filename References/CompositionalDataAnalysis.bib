    Purpose

    Human microbiome studies are within the realm of compositional data with the absolute abundances of microbes not recoverable from sequence data alone. In compositional data analysis, each sample consists of proportions of various organisms with a sum constrained to a constant. This simple feature can lead traditional statistical treatments when naively applied to produce errant results and spurious correlations.
    Methods
    
    We review the origins of compositionality in microbiome data, the theory and usage of compositional data analysis in this setting and some recent attempts at solutions to these problems.
    Results
    
    Microbiome sequence data sets are typically high dimensional, with the number of taxa much greater than the number of samples, and sparse as most taxa are only observed in a small number of samples. These features of microbiome sequence data interact with compositionality to produce additional challenges in analysis.
    Conclusions
    
    Despite sophisticated approaches to statistical transformation, the analysis of compositional data may remain a partially intractable problem, limiting inference. We suggest that current research needs include better generation of simulated data and further study of how the severity of compositional effects changes when sampling microbial communities of widely differing diversity.

    The human microbiome is the totality of all microbes in and on the human body, and its importance in health and disease has been increasingly recognized. High-throughput sequencing technologies have recently enabled scientists to obtain an unbiased quantification of all microbes constituting the microbiome. Often, a single sample can produce hundreds of millions of short sequencing reads. However, unique characteristics of the data produced by the new technologies, as well as the sheer magnitude of these data, make drawing valid biological inferences from microbiome studies difficult. Analysis of these big data poses great statistical and computational challenges. Important issues include normalization and quantification of relative taxa, bacterial genes, and metabolic abundances; incorporation of phylogenetic information into analysis of metagenomics data; and multivariate analysis of high-dimensional compositional data. We review existing methods, point out their limitations, and outline future research directions.

    A workshop held at the 2015 annual meeting of the Canadian Society of Microbiologists highlighted compositional data analysis methods and the importance of exploratory data analysis for the analysis of microbiome data sets generated by high-throughput DNA sequencing. A summary of the content of that workshop, a review of new methods of analysis, and information on the importance of careful analyses are presented herein. The workshop focussed on explaining the rationale behind the use of compositional data analysis, and a demonstration of these methods for the examination of 2 microbiome data sets. A clear understanding of bioinformatics methodologies and the type of data being analyzed is essential, given the growing number of studies uncovering the critical role of the microbiome in health and disease and the need to understand alterations to its composition and function following intervention with fecal transplant, probiotics, diet, and pharmaceutical agents.
