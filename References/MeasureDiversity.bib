    Hill numbers or the effective number of species are increasingly used to quantify species diversity of an assemblage. 
    Hill numbers were recently extended to phylogenetic diversity, which incorporates species evolutionary history, as well as to functional diversity, which considers the differences among species traits. 
    We review these extensions and integrate them into a framework of attribute diversity (the effective number of entities or total attribute value) based on Hill numbers of taxonomic entities (species), phylogenetic entities (branches of unit-length), or functional entities (species-pairs with unit-distance between species). 
    This framework unifies ecologists' measures of species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and distance-based functional diversity. 
    It also provides a unified method of decomposing these diversities and constructing normalized taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional similarity and differentiation measures, including N-assemblage phylogenetic or functional generalizations of the classic Jaccard, Sørensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indexes. 
    A real example shows how this framework extracts ecological meaning from complex data.

    Three metrics of species diversity – species richness, the Shannon index and the Simpson index – are still widely used in ecology, despite decades of valid critiques leveled against them. 
    Developing a robust diversity metric has been challenging because, unlike many variables ecologists measure, the diversity of a community often cannot be estimated in an unbiased way based on a random sample from that community. 
    Over the past decade, ecologists have begun to incorporate two important tools for estimating diversity: coverage and Hill diversity. 
    Coverage is a method for equalizing samples that is, on theoretical grounds, preferable to other commonly used methods such as equal-effort sampling, or rarefying datasets to equal sample size. 
    Hill diversity comprises a spectrum of diversity metrics and is based on three key insights. 
    First, species richness and variants of the Shannon and Simpson indices are all special cases of one general equation. 
    Second, richness, Shannon and Simpson can be expressed on the same scale and in units of species. 
    Third, there is no way to eliminate the effect of relative abundance from estimates of any of these diversity metrics, including species richness. 
    Rather, a researcher must choose the relative sensitivity of the metric towards rare and common species, a concept which we describe as ‘leverage.' 
    In this paper we explain coverage and Hill diversity, provide guidelines for how to use them together to measure species diversity, and demonstrate their use with examples from our own data. 
    We show why researchers will obtain more robust results when they estimate the Hill diversity of equal-coverage samples, rather than using other methods such as equal-effort sampling or traditional sample rarefaction.

    Realistic measures of biodiversity should reflect not only the relative abundances of species, but also the differences between them. 
    We present a natural family of diversity measures taking both factors into account. 
    This is not just another addition to the already long list of diversity indices. 
    Instead, a single formula subsumes many of the most popular indices, including Shannon's, Simpson's, species richness, and Rao's quadratic entropy. 
    These popular indices can then be used and understood in a unified way, and the relationships between them are made plain. 
    The new measures are, moreover, effective numbers, so that percentage changes and ratio comparisons of diversity value are meaningful.
    We advocate the use of diversity profiles, which provide a faithful graphical representation of the shape of a community; they show how the perceived diversity changes as the emphasis shifts from rare to common species. 
    Communities can usefully be compared by comparing their diversity profiles. 
    We show by example that this is a far more subtle method than any relying on a single statistic.
    Some ecologists view diversity indices with suspicion, questioning whether they are biologically meaningful. 
    By dropping the naive assumption that distinct species have nothing in common, working with effective numbers, and using diversity profiles, we arrive at a system of diversity measurement that should lay much of this suspicion to rest.

      Hill numbers (or the “effective number of species”) are increasingly used to characterize species diversity of an assemblage. 
      This work extends Hill numbers to incorporate species pairwise functional distances calculated from species traits. 
      We derive a parametric class of functional Hill numbers, which quantify “the effective number of equally abundant and (functionally) equally distinct species” in an assemblage. 
      We also propose a class of mean functional diversity (per species), which quantifies the effective sum of functional distances between a fixed species to all other species. 
      The product of the functional Hill number and the mean functional diversity thus quantifies the (total) functional diversity, i.e., the effective total distance between species of the assemblage. 
      The three measures (functional Hill numbers, mean functional diversity and total functional diversity) quantify different aspects of species trait space, and all are based on species abundance and species pairwise functional distances. 
      When all species are equally distinct, our functional Hill numbers reduce to ordinary Hill numbers. When species abundances are not considered or species are equally abundant, our total functional diversity reduces to the sum of all pairwise distances between species of an assemblage. 
      The functional Hill numbers and the mean functional diversity both satisfy a replication principle, implying the total functional diversity satisfies a quadratic replication principle. 
      When there are multiple assemblages defined by the investigator, each of the three measures of the pooled assemblage (gamma) can be multiplicatively decomposed into alpha and beta components, and the two components are independent. 
      The resulting beta component measures pure functional differentiation among assemblages and can be further transformed to obtain several classes of normalized functional similarity (or differentiation) measures, including N-assemblage functional generalizations of the classic Jaccard, Sørensen, Horn and Morisita-Horn similarity indices. 
      The proposed measures are applied to artificial and real data for illustration.

    The first step of any metagenome sequencing project is to get the inventory of OTU abundances (operational taxonomic units) and/or metagenomic gene abundances. 
    The former is generated with 16S-rRNA-tagged amplicon sequencing technology, and the latter can be generated from either gene-targeted or whole-sample shotgun metagenomics technologies. 
    With 16S-rRNA data sets, measuring community diversity with diversity indexes such as species richness and Shannon's index has been a de facto standard analysis; nevertheless, similarly comprehensive approaches to metagenomic gene abundances are still largely missing, despite that both OTU and gene abundances are DNA reads. 
    Here, we adapt the Hill numbers, which were reintroduced to macrocommunity ecology recently and are now widely regarded as a most appropriate measure system for ecological diversity, for measuring metagenome alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversities, and similarity. 
    Our proposal includes the following: (a) Metagenomic gene (MG) diversity measures the single-gene-level metagenome diversity; (b) Type-I metagenome functional gene cluster (MFGC) diversity measures the diversity of functional gene clusters but ignoring within-cluster gene abundance information; (c) Type-II MFGC diversity considers within-cluster gene abundances information and integrates gene-cluster-level metagenome diversity and functional gene redundancy information; and (d) Four classes of Hill-numbers-based similarity metrics, including local gene overlap, regional gene overlap, gene homogeneity measure and gene turnover complement, were introduced in terms of MG and MFGC, respectively. 
    We demonstrate the proposal with the gut metagenomes from healthy and IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) cohorts. 
    The Hill numbers offer a unified approach to cohesively and comprehensively measuring the ecological and metagenome diversities of microbiomes.

    With the advent of DNA sequencing-based techniques, the way we detect and measure biodiversity is undergoing a radical shift. 
    There is also an increasing awareness of the need to employ intuitively meaningful diversity measures based on unified statistical frameworks, so that different results can be easily interpreted and compared. 
    This article aimed to serve as a guide to implementing biodiversity assessment using the general statistical framework developed around Hill numbers into the analysis of systems characterized using DNA sequencing-based techniques (e.g., diet, microbiomes and ecosystem biodiversity). Specifically, we discuss (a) the DNA-based approaches for defining the types upon which diversity is measured, (b) how to weight the importance of each type, (c) the differences between abundance-based versus incidence-based approaches, (d) the implementation of phylogenetic information into diversity measurement, (e) hierarchical diversity partitioning, (f) dissimilarity and overlap measurement and (g) how to deal with zero-inflated, insufficient and biased data. 
    All steps are reproduced with real data to also provide step-by-step bash and R scripts to enable straightforward implementation of the explained procedures.

    There are many ecological diversity measures, but their suitability for use with highly diverse bacterial communities is unclear and seldom considered. 
    We assessed a range of species richness and evenness/dominance indices, and the use of species abundance models using samples of bacteria from zinc-contaminated and control soils. 
    Bacteria were assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis of 236 clones from each soil. 
    The reduced diversity apparent in the contaminated soil was reflected by the diversity indices to varying degrees. 
    The number of clones analysed and the weighting given to rare vs. abundant OTUs are the most important considerations when selecting measures. 
    Our preferences, arrived at using theory and practical experience, include: the log series index alpha; the Q statistic (but only if coverage is 50% or more); the Berger–Parker and Simpson's indices, although their ecological relevance may be limited; and, unexpectedly, the Shannon–Wiener and Shannon evenness indices, even though their meanings may not be clear and their values inaccurate when coverage is low. 
    For extrapolation, the equation for the log series distribution seems the best for extrapolating from OTU accumulation curves while non-parametric methods, such as Chao 1, show promise for estimating total OTU richness. 
    Due to a preponderance of single-occurrence OTUs, none of the five species abundance models fit the OTU abundance distribution of the control soil, but both the log and log normal models fit the less diverse contaminated soil. 
    Species abundance models are useful, irrespective of coverage, because they address the whole distribution of a sample, aiding comparison by revealing overall trends as well as specific changes in particular abundance classes.

    Diversity (or biodiversity) is typically measured by a species count (richness) and sometimes with an evenness index; it may also be measured by a proportional statistic that combines both measures (e.g., Shannon‐Weiner index or 𝐻′). These diversity measures are hypothesized to be positively and strongly correlated, but this null hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We used the results of Caswell's neutral model to generate null relationships between richness (S), evenness (𝐽′), and proportional diversity (𝐻′). We tested predictions of the null model against empirical relationships describing data in a literature survey and in four individual studies conducted across various scales. Empirical relationships between
    log𝑆
    or
    𝐽′
    and
    𝐻′
    differed from the null model when <10 species were tested and in plants, vertebrates, and fungi. The empirical relationships were similar to the null model when >10 and <100 species were tested and in invertebrates. If >100 species were used to estimate diversity, the relation between
    log𝑆
    and
    𝐻′
    was negative. The strongest predictive models included
    log𝑆
    and
    𝐽′
    . A path analysis indicated that
    log𝑆
    and
    𝐽′
    were always negatively related, that empirical observations could not be explained without including indirect effects, and that differences between the partials may indicate ecological effects, which suggests that S and
    𝐽′
    act like diversity components or that diversity should be measured using a compound statistic.

    The main components of species diversity are richness and evenness. Species richness has been the subject of biodiversity studies more often than species evenness. Some simulated models suggest that the relationship between these two components is equal and predictable in a stable environment. This study was conducted in a human-shaped and unstable environment in arable field boundaries. A total of 30 sampling plots were laid out at random in the boundaries. Vegetation at the sites was of meadow type. The relationship between species richness and evenness, and their responses to edaphic nutrient factors in the field boundaries, were examined by correlation analysis and an ordination method. Correlation analyses demonstrated that no consistent pattern was present in the relationship between species evenness and species richness in this human-shaped ecosystem. Species richness and evenness also had different responses to edaphic factors, with species richness being negatively correlated with phosphorus, and species evenness negatively correlated with the ratio of organic carbon to total nitrogen in soil. The results indicate that different and independent ecological processes determine species richness and evenness. The relationship between these two components may be site-specific, reflecting variation in resource utilization by plant species. The pattern thus reflects the spatial heterogeneity of disturbances or ‘patchiness’ of resources between sites in a semi-natural ecosystem.
