\textbf{1. Gomez-Polo et al., 2017, An exceptional family: Ophiocordyceps-allied fungus dominates the microbiome of soft scale insects (Hemiptera Sternorrhyncha: Coccidae).} \newline
Ribosomal genes from seven soft scale (Coccidae) species showed high prevalence of an \textit{Ophiocordyceps}-allied fungal symbiont, which is from an lineage widely known as entomopathogenic. 
The \textit{Ophiocordyceps}-allied fungus from soft scales is closely related to fungi described from other hemipterans, and they appear to be monophyletic, although the phylogenies of the \textit{Ophiocordyceps}-allied fungi and their hosts do not appear to be congruent. 
Microscopic observations show that the fungal cells are lemon-shaped, are distributed throughout the hostâ€™s body and are
present in the eggs, suggesting vertical transmission.

\textbf{2. Deng et al., 2021, The ubiquity and development-related abundance dynamics of Ophiocordyceps fungi in soft scale insects.} \newline
Nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene fragment was used to analyze the diversity of fungal communities in 28 soft scale (Coccidae) species. 
Coccidae-associated \textit{Ophiocordyceps} fungi (COF) were prevalent in all 28 tested species with high relative abundance. 
Meanwhile, the first and second instars of \textit{C. japonicus} had high relative abundance of COF, while the relative
abundances in other stages were low, ranging from 0.68\% to 2.07\%. 
The result of fluorescent in situ hybridization showed that the COF were widely present in \textbf{hemolymph} and vertically transmitted from mother to offspring.
