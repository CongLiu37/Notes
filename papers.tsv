Burgess et al.	2023	Annual Reviews	tRNA dysregulation in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases	"It is notable that for 15 mRNA codons, no tRNA genes with a corresponding anticodon are found in the human genome ( Table 1 ). Although incomplete genome annotation may contribute, this is a reproducible phenomenon across genomes (Ehrlich et al. 2021). The missing anticodons are consistently one of a group of tRNAs in which the first base of the anticodon, corresponding to the more variable third base of the codon, the wobble position, is not represented. The proposed explanation for this is that translational accuracy is actually greater in some cases where non-Watson–Crick base pairing is used, which relies on posttranscriptional modification of the tRNAs to allow a different anticodon tRNA to decode the mRNA (Akashi 1994, Blanchet et al. 2018, Gingold & Pilpel 2011). There is now data in Escherichia coli directly supporting this hypothesis (Sun & Zhang 2022)."
